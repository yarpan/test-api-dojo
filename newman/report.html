A meteor. While photographing the Andromeda galaxy in 2016, near the peak of the Perseid Meteor Shower, a small pebble from deep space crossed right in front of our Milky Way Galaxy&#x27;s far-distant companion. The small meteor took only a fraction of a second to pass through this 10-degree field.  The meteor flared several times while braking violently upon entering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  The green color was created, at least in part, by the meteor&#x27;s gas glowing as it vaporized. Although the exposure was timed to catch a Perseid meteor, the orientation of the imaged streak seems a better match to a meteor from the Southern Delta Aquariids, a meteor shower that peaked a few weeks earlier.  Not coincidentally, the Perseid Meteor Shower peaks next week, although this year the meteors will have to outshine a sky brightened by a nearly full moon.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/MeteorM31_hemmerich_1948.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Meteor before Galaxy&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/MeteorM31_hemmerich_960.jpg&quot;}

The wedge-shaped cosmic cloudlet lies within a relatively crowded region of space though. About 7,000 light-years distant and filled with glowing gas and an embedded cluster of young stars, the region is known as M16 or the Eagle Nebula. Hubble&#x27;s iconic images of the Eagle Nebula include the famous star-forming Pillars of Creation, towering structures of interstellar gas and dust 4 to 5 light-years long. But this small dark nebula, known to some as a Bok globule, is a fraction of a light-year across. The Bok globule stands out in silhouette against the expansive background of M16&#x27;s diffuse glow. Found scattered within emission nebulae and star clusters, Bok globules are small interstellar clouds of cold molecular gas and obscuring dust that also form stars within their dense, collapsing cores.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Small Dark Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1_1024.jpg&quot;}

Do you see the ruins of an abandoned outpost on a hill? (The outpost is on Askold Island, Russia.)  Do you see a photographer with a headlamp contemplating surreal surroundings?

No. Capturing this stunning alignment took careful planning: being in the right place at the right time. In the featured image taken in June 2024 from Otago, New Zealand, the bright central core of our Milky Way Galaxy, home to the many of our Galaxy&#x27;s 400 billion stars, can be seen between two picturesque rocks spires.  For observers in Earth&#x27;s Northern Hemisphere, the core is only visible throughout the summer. As Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Milky Way become visible at different angles at different times of the night. As Earth rotates, the orientation of the Milky Way in the sky also shifts -- sometimes standing vertically as seen in the featured image, and other times stretching parallel to the horizon, making it harder to see. In early June, observers can watch it emerge low on the horizon after sunset and gradually arc upward to reveal its full grandeur.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_1874.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way Through Otago Spires&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMatipon Tangmatitham \n(NARIT)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;If you know where to look, you can see a thermonuclear explosion from a white dwarf star. Possibly two.  Such explosions are known as novas and the detonations are currently faintly visible with the unaided eye in Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere -- but are more easily seen with binoculars. Pictured, Nova Lupi 2025 (V462 Lupi) was captured toward the southern constellation of the Wolf (Lupus) last week near the central plane of our Milky Way galaxy.  Nova Lupi 2025 was originally discovered on June 12 and peaked in brightness about a week later. Similarly, Nova Velorum 2025, toward the southern constellation of the Ship Sails (Vela), was discovered on June 25 and peaked a few days later.  A nova somewhere in our Galaxy becomes briefly visible to the unaided eye only every year or two, so it is quite unusual to have two novas visible simultaneously.  Meanwhile, humanity awaits even a different nova: T Coronae Borealis, which should become visible in northern skies and is expected to become even brighter.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/V462Lupi_Pon_1689.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nova V462 Lupi Now Visible&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/V462Lupi_Pon_960_annotated.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Alberto Pisabarro&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Face-on spiral galaxy NGC 6946 and open star cluster NGC 6939 share this cosmic snapshot, composed with over 68 hours of image data captured with a small telescope on planet Earth. The field of view spans spans about 1 degree or 2 full moons on the sky toward the northern constellation Cepheus. Seen through faint interstellar dust clouds near the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, the stars of open cluster NGC 6939 are 5,600 light-years in the distance, near bottom right in the frame. Face-on spiral galaxy NGC 6946 is at top left, but lies some 22 million light-years away. In the last 100 years, 10 supernovae have been discovered in NGC 6946, the latest one seen in 2017. By comparison, the average rate of supernovae in our Milky Way is about 1 every 100 years or so. Of course, NGC 6946 is also known as The Fireworks Galaxy.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/N6946N6939pisabarro.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 6946 and NGC 6939&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/N6946N6939pisabarro1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Massimo Di Fusco&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-05&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Difficult to capture, this mysterious, squid-shaped interstellar cloud spans nearly three full moons in planet Earth&#x27;s sky. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula&#x27;s bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, one investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/Ou4_difusco.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ou4: The Giant Squid Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/Ou4_difusco1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why is there a spiral around the North Pole of Mars?  Each winter this pole develops a new outer layer about one meter thick composed of carbon dioxide frozen out of the thin Martian atmosphere.  This fresh layer is deposited on a water-ice layer that exists year round.  Strong winds blow down from above the cap&#x27;s center and swirl due to the spin of the red planet -- contributing to Planum Boreum&#x27;s spiral structure.  The featured image is a perspective mosaic generated in 2017 from numerous images taken by ESA&#x27;s Mars Express and elevations extracted from the laser altimeter aboard NASA&#x27;s Mars Global Surveyor mission.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MarsNorthPole_MarsExpress_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Spiral North Pole of Mars&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MarsNorthPole_MarsExpress_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-07&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;It came from outer space.  An object from outside our Solar System is now passing through at high speed. Classified as a comet because of its gaseous coma, 3I/ATLAS is only the third identified macroscopic object as being so alien. The comet&#x27;s trajectory is shown in white on the featured map, where the orbits of Jupiter, Mars, and Earth are shown in gold, red, and blue. Currently Comet 3I/ATLAS is about the distance of Jupiter from the Sun -- but closing, with its closest approach to our Sun expected to be within the orbit of Mars in late October. Expected to pass near both Mars and Jupiter, 3I/ATLAS is not expected to pass close to the Earth.  The origin of Comet 3I/ATLAS remains unknown. Although initial activity indicates a relatively normal comet, future observations about 3I/ATLAS&#x27; composition and nature will surely continue.

Perhaps the most famous star cluster in the sky, its brightest stars can be seen even from the light-polluted cities. But your unaided eye can also see its nebulosity -- the gas and dust surrounding it -- under dark skies. However, telescopes can catch even more. The bright blue stars of the Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, light up their surrounding dust, causing it to appear a diffuse blue that can only be seen under long exposures.

Also known as M20, it lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. But, the red emission region roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes is what lends the Trifid its popular name. Pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars, above and right of the emission nebula&#x27;s center, appear in famous Hubble Space Telescope close-up images of the region.

Planetary nebula Mz3 is being cast off by a star similar to our Sun that is, surely, round.  Why then would the gas that is streaming away create an ant-shaped nebula that is distinctly not round?  Clues might include the high 1000-kilometer per second speed of the expelled gas, the light-year long length of the structure, and the magnetism of the star featured here at the nebula&#x27;s center.  One possible answer is that Mz3 is hiding a second, dimmer star that orbits close in to the bright star.  A competing hypothesis holds that the central star&#x27;s own spin and magnetic field are channeling the gas.  Since the central star appears to be so similar to our own Sun, astronomers hope that increased understanding of the history of this giant space ant can provide useful insight into the likely future of our own Sun and Earth.

NGC 2685 is a confirmed polar ring galaxy - a rare type of galaxy with stars, gas and dust orbiting in rings perpendicular to the plane of a flat galactic disk. The bizarre configuration could be caused by the chance capture of material from another galaxy by a disk galaxy, with the captured debris strung out in a rotating ring. Still, observed properties of NGC 2685 suggest that the rotating helix structure is remarkably old and stable. In this sharp view of the peculiar system also known as Arp 336 or the Helix galaxy, the strange, perpendicular rings are easy to trace as they pass in front of the galactic disk, along with other disturbed outer structures.

Hebes Chasma is a depression just north of the enormous Valles Marineris canyon.  Since the depression is unconnected to other surface features, it is unclear where the internal material went. Inside Hebes Chasma is Hebes Mensa, a 5 kilometer high mesa that appears to have undergone an unusual partial collapse -- a collapse that might be providing clues. The featured image, taken by ESA&#x27;s robotic Mars Express spacecraft currently orbiting Mars, shows great details of the chasm and the unusual horseshoe shaped indentation in the central mesa. Material from the mesa appears to have flowed onto the floor of the chasm, while a possible dark layer appears to have pooled like ink on a downslope landing.  One hypothesis holds that salty rock composes some lower layers in Hebes Chasma, with the salt dissolving in melted ice flows that drained through holes into an underground aquifer.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/HebesChasma_esa_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Collapse in Hebes Chasma on Mars&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/HebesChasma_esa_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-16&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Would the Rosette Nebula by any other name look as sweet?

Inside the nebula lies an open cluster of bright young stars designated NGC 2244. These stars formed about four million years ago from the nebular material and their stellar winds are clearing a hole in the nebula&#x27;s center, insulated by a layer of dust and hot gas. Ultraviolet light from the hot cluster stars causes the surrounding nebula to glow.

The left panel tracks the comet as it moves across the sky against fixed background stars in successive exposures. Three different filters were used, shown in red, green, and blue. In the right panel the multiple exposures are registered and combined to form a single image of the comet. The comet&#x27;s interstellar origin is also clear from its orbit, determined to be an eccentric, highly hyperbolic orbit that does not loop back around the Sun and will return 3I/ATLAS to interstellar space.

Tidally locked in this configuration, the synchronous rotation always keeps one side, the nearside, facing Earth.

Yes, when the first explosion acts like a detonator for the second. This is a leading hypothesis for the cause of supernova remnant (SNR) 0509-67.5.  In this two-star system, gravity causes the larger and fluffier star to give up mass to a smaller and denser white dwarf companion. Eventually the white dwarf&#x27;s near-surface temperature goes so high that it explodes, creating a shock wave that goes both out and in -- and so triggers a full Type Ia supernova near the center. Recent images of the SNR 0509-67.5 system, like the featured image from the Very Large Telescope in Chile, show two shells with radii and compositions consistent with the double detonation hypothesis. This system, SNR 0509-67.5 is also famous for two standing mysteries: why its bright supernova wasn&#x27;t noted 400 years ago, and why no visible companion star remains.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/DoubleSN_ESO_3000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Double Detonation Supernova&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/DoubleSN_ESO_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nJason Rice\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever seen a fireball?

You&#x27;re not alone. Details of what causes lightning are still being researched, but it is known that inside some clouds, internal updrafts cause collisions between ice and snow that slowly separate charges between cloud tops and bottoms. The rapid electrical discharges that are lightning soon result.  Lightning usually takes a jagged course, rapidly heating a thin column of air to about three times the surface temperature of the Sun.  The resulting shock wave starts supersonically and decays into the loud sound known as thunder.  On average, around the world, about 6,000 lightning bolts occur between clouds and the Earth every minute.

But analyses of new results show that the effects of the collision are different than expected -- and we are trying to understand why.  Featured here is the time lapse video taken by the ejected LICIACube camera LUKE showing about 250 seconds of the expanding debris field of Dimorphos after the collision, with un-impacted Didymos passing in the foreground.  In 2026, Europe&#x27;s Hera mission will reach the asteroids and release three spacecraft to better study the matter.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;other&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Collision at Asteroid Dimorphos&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nGeorge Chatzifrantzis\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Is the Helix Nebula looking at you? No, not in any biological sense, but it does look quite like an eye. The Helix Nebula is so named because it also appears that you are looking down the axis of a helix. In actuality, it is now understood to have a surprisingly complex geometry, including radial filaments and extended outer loops.  The Helix Nebula (aka NGC 7293) is one of brightest and closest examples of a planetary nebula, a gas cloud created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star. The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a white dwarf star, glows in light so energetic it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce. The featured picture, taken in red, green, and blue but highlighted by light emitted primarily by hydrogen was created from 12 hours of exposure through a personal telescope located in Greece.  A close-up of the inner edge of the Helix Nebula shows complex gas knots the origin of which are  still being researched.

Hot solar plasma jumps off the Sun&#x27;s surface into prominences, with the most common type of prominence being a simple loop.  The loop shape originates from the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field, which is traced by spiraling electrons and protons.  Many loops into the Sun&#x27;s lower corona are large enough to envelop the Earth and are stable enough to last days.  They commonly occur near active regions that also include dark sunspots.  The featured panel shows four loops, each of which was captured near the Sun&#x27;s edge during 2024 and 2025. The images were taken by a personal telescope in Mantova, Italy and in a very specific color of light emitted primarily by hydrogen. Some solar prominences suddenly break open and eject particles into the Solar System, setting up a space weather sequence that can affect the skies and wires of Earth.

Light from that supernova was first detected by telescopes on planet Earth on July 14th though, and the extragalactic transient is now known to astronomers as supernova 2025rbs. Presently the brightest supernova in planet Earth&#x27;s sky, 2025rbs is a Type Ia supernova, likely caused by the thermonuclear detonation of a white dwarf star that accreted material from a companion in a binary star system.  Type Ia supernovae are used as standard candles to establish the distance scale of the universe. The host galaxy of 2025rbs is NGC 7331. Itself a bright spiral galaxy in the northern constellation Pegasus, NGC 7331 is often touted as an analog to our own Milky Way.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/2025rbsAnnotated1024.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Supernova 2025rbs in NGC 7331&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/2025rbsAnnotated1024.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Peter Bresseler&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-08-01&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A small, dark, nebula looks isolated near the center of this telescopic close-up. The wedge-shaped cosmic cloudlet lies within a relatively crowded region of space though. About 7,000 light-years distant and filled with glowing gas and an embedded cluster of young stars, the region is known as M16 or the Eagle Nebula. Hubble&#x27;s iconic images of the Eagle Nebula include the famous star-forming Pillars of Creation, towering structures of interstellar gas and dust 4 to 5 light-years long. But this small dark nebula, known to some as a Bok globule, is a fraction of a light-year across. The Bok globule stands out in silhouette against the expansive background of M16&#x27;s diffuse glow. Found scattered within emission nebulae and star clusters, Bok globules are small interstellar clouds of cold molecular gas and obscuring dust that also form stars within their dense, collapsing cores.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Small Dark Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1_1024.jpg&quot;}]

In the center, in the dark, do you see a night sky filled with stars? Do you see a sunset to the left? Clouds all around? Do you see the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy running down the middle? Do you see the ruins of an abandoned outpost on a hill? (The outpost is on Askold Island, Russia.)  Do you see a photographer with a headlamp contemplating surreal surroundings? (The featured image is a panorama of 38 images taken last month and compiled into a Little Planet projection.)  Do you see a rugged path lined with steps? Or do you see the eye of a dragon?&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/EyeDragonSky_Komlev_2000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Eye Sky a Dragon&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/EyeDragonSky_Komlev_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nKavan Chay; \nText: \nOgetay Kayali\n(Michigan Tech U.)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Does the Milky Way always rise between these two rocks? No. Capturing this stunning alignment took careful planning: being in the right place at the right time. In the featured image taken in June 2024 from Otago, New Zealand, the bright central core of our Milky Way Galaxy, home to the many of our Galaxy&#x27;s 400 billion stars, can be seen between two picturesque rocks spires.  For observers in Earth&#x27;s Northern Hemisphere, the core is only visible throughout the summer. As Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Milky Way become visible at different angles at different times of the night. As Earth rotates, the orientation of the Milky Way in the sky also shifts -- sometimes standing vertically as seen in the featured image, and other times stretching parallel to the horizon, making it harder to see. In early June, observers can watch it emerge low on the horizon after sunset and gradually arc upward to reveal its full grandeur.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_1874.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way Through Otago Spires&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_960.jpg&quot;}]

Of the three stars in the system, the dimmest -- called Proxima Centauri -- is actually the nearest star. The bright stars Alpha Centauri A and B form a close binary as they are separated by only 23 times the Earth- Sun distance - slightly greater than the distance between Uranus and the Sun. The Alphasystem is not visible in much of the northern hemisphere. Alpha Centauri A, also known as Rigil Kentaurus, is the brightest star in the constellation of Centaurus and is the fourth brightest star in the night sky. Sirius is the brightest even though it is more than twice as far away. By an exciting coincidence, Alpha Centauri A is the same type of star as our Sun, and Proxima Centauri is now known to have a potentially habitable exoplanet.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/AlphaCen_Cantrell_3429.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Alpha Centauri: The Closest Star System&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/AlphaCen_Cantrell_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Betul Turksoy&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Recorded during 2024, this year-spanning series of images reveals a pattern in the seasonal drift of the Sun&#x27;s daily motion through planet Earth&#x27;s sky. Known to some as an analemma, the figure-eight curve was captured in exposures taken only at 1pm local time on clear days from Kayseri, Turkiye. Of course the Sun&#x27;s position on the 2024 solstice dates was at the top and bottom of the curve. They correspond to the astronomical beginning of summer and winter in the north. The points along the curve half-way between the solstices, but not the figure-eight curve crossing point, mark the 2024 equinoxes and the start of spring and fall. Regional peaks and dormant volcano Mount Erciyes lie along the southern horizon in the 2024 timelapse skyscape.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/solaranalemma2024-4-5BetulT.jpeg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Solar Analemma 2024&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/solaranalemma2024-4-5BetulT1024.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Josh Dury&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;clipses tend to come in pairs. Twice a year, during an eclipse season that lasts about 34 days, Sun, Moon, and Earth can nearly align. Then the full and new phases of the Moon, separated by just over 14 days, create a lunar and a solar eclipse. But only rarely is the alignment at both new moon and full moon phases during a single eclipse season close enough to produce a pair with both total (or a total and an annular) lunar and solar eclipses. More often, partial eclipses are part of any eclipse season. In fact, the last eclipse season of 2024 produced this fortnight-separated eclipse pair: a partial lunar eclipse on 18 September and an annular solar eclipse on 2 October. The time-lapse composite images were captured from Somerset, UK (left) and Rapa Nui planet Earth. The 2025 eclipse seasons will see a total lunar eclipse on 14 March paired with a partial solar eclipse on 29 March, and a total lunar eclipse on 8 September followed by a partial solar eclipse on 21 September.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/APODEclipsePair2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Eclipse Pair&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/APODEclipsePair1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Barden Ridge Observatory&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;rth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun is not a circle, it&#x27;s an ellipse. The point along its elliptical orbit where our fair planet is closest to the Sun is called perihelion. This year perihelion is today, January 4, at 13:28 UTC, only a few hours before this H-alpha picture of the active Sun was taken. At perihelion the Earth was about 147 million kilometers from the Sun. For comparison, at aphelion on last July 3 Earth was at its farthest distance from the Sun, some 152 million kilometers away. But distance from the Sun doesn&#x27;t determine Earth&#x27;s seasons. It&#x27;s only by coincidence that the beginning of southern summer (northern winter) on the December solstice is within 14 days of Earth&#x27;s perihelion date. And it&#x27;s only by coincidence that Earth&#x27;s perihelion date is within 11 days of the historic perihelion of NASA&#x27;s Parker Solar Probe. Launched in 2018, the Parker Solar Probe flew within 6.2 million kilometers of the Sun&#x27;s surface on 2024 December 24, breaking its own record for closest perihelion for a spacecraft from planet Earth.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/20250104PeriSolHaNeg.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Welcome to Perihelion&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/20250104PeriSolHaNeg1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-05&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever seen a rocket launch -- from space?  A close inspection of the featured time-lapse video will reveal a rocket rising to Earth orbit as seen from the International Space Station (ISS).  The Russian Soyuz-FG rocket was launched in November 2018 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carrying a Progress MS-10 (also 71P) module to bring needed supplies to the ISS.  Highlights in the 90-second video (condensing about 15-minutes) include city lights and clouds visible on the Earth on the lower left, blue and gold bands of atmospheric airglow running diagonally across the center, and distant stars on the upper right that set behind the Earth. A lower stage can be seen falling back to Earth as the robotic supply ship fires its thrusters and begins to close on the ISS, a space laboratory that celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2023. Astronauts who live aboard the Earth-orbiting ISS conduct, among more practical duties, numerous science experiments that expand human knowledge and enable future commercial industry in low Earth orbit.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rocket Launch as Seen from the International Space Station&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1R3dTdcpSU?rel&#x3D;0&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Billions of years from now, only one of these two galaxies will remain.  Until then, spiral galaxies NGC 2207 and IC 2163 will slowly pull each other apart, creating tides of matter, sheets of shocked gas, lanes of dark dust, bursts of star formation, and streams of cast-away stars.  The featured image in scientifically assigned colors is a composite of Hubble exposures in visible light and Webb exposures in infrared light. Astronomers predict that NGC 2207, the larger galaxy on the right, will eventually incorporate IC 2163, the smaller galaxy on the left.  In the most recent encounter that about peaked 40 million years ago, the smaller galaxy is swinging around counter-clockwise and is now slightly behind the larger galaxy.  The space between stars is so vast that when galaxies collide, the stars in them usually do not collide.

The new year meant that the Earth had returned to its usual place in its orbit on January 1, a place a few days before its closest approach to the Sun.  The first of the two red skyglows, on the left, was a red aurora, complete with vertical rays, caused by a blast from the Sun pushing charged particles into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  The second red glow, most prominent on the far right, was possibly a SAR arc caused by a river of charged particles flowing across Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  Although both appear red, the slight color difference is likely due to the aurora being emitted by both oxygen and nitrogen, whereas the higher SAR arc was possibly emitted more purely by atmospheric oxygen. The featured image was taken on January 1 from near Pieve di Cadore in Italy.

A huge fireball of hot gas shoots out in all directions.  When this gas slams into the existing interstellar medium, it heats up so much it glows. Two different supernova remnants (SNRs) are visible in the featured image, taken at the Ouka\u00efmeden Observatory in Morocco.  The blue soccer ball-looking nebula toward the upper left is SNR G179.0+02.6, which appears to be the smaller one.  This supernova, about 11,000 light years distant, detonated about 50,000 years ago. Although composed mostly of hydrogen gas, the blue light is emitted by a trace amount of oxygen.  The seemingly larger SNR, dominating the lower right of the frame, is the Spaghetti Nebula, cataloged as Simeis 147 and sh2-240.  This supernova, only about 3,000 light years away, exploded about 40,000 years ago. Comparatively, even though they appear different sizes, both supernova remnants are not only roughly the same age, but about the same size, too.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Supernovas_Vetter_1653.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Supernova Remnants Big and Small&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Supernovas_Vetter_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Dave Doctor&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The colorful, spiky stars are in the foreground of this image taken with a small telescope on planet Earth. They lie well within our own Milky Way Galaxy. But the two eye-catching galaxies in the frame lie far beyond the Milky Way, at a distance of over 300 million light-years. The galaxies&#x27; twisted and distorted appearance is due to mutual gravitational tides as the pair engage in close encounters. Cataloged as Arp 273 (also as UGC 1810), these galaxies do look peculiar, but interacting galaxies are now understood to be common in the universe. Closer to home, the large spiral Andromeda Galaxy is known to be some 2 million light-years away and inexorably approaching the Milky Way.  In fact the far away peculiar galaxies of Arp 273 may offer an analog of the far future encounter of Andromeda and Milky Way. Repeated galaxy encounters on a cosmic timescale ultimately result in a merger into a single galaxy of stars. From our perspective, the bright cores of the Arp 273 galaxies are separated by only a little over 100,000 light-years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Image171a.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Peculiar Galaxies of Arp 273&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Image171a.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Long Xin&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;An unassuming region in the constellation Taurus holds these dark and dusty nebulae.

What remains is one of the largest impact craters on one of Saturn&#x27;s smallest round moons.  Analysis indicates that a slightly larger impact would have destroyed Mimas entirely.  The huge crater, named Herschel after the 1789 discoverer of Mimas, Sir William Herschel, spans about 130 kilometers and is featured here. Mimas&#x27; low mass produces a surface gravity just strong enough to create a spherical body but weak enough to allow such relatively large surface features. Mimas is made of mostly water ice with a smattering of rock - so it is accurately described as a big dirty snowball. The featured image was taken during the closest-ever flyby of the robot spacecraft Cassini past Mimas in 2010 while in orbit around Saturn.

Outside the glow of the Sun, Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) would be one of the more remarkable comet sights of recent years, reflecting about as much sunlight to Earth as Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS did in October, and now rivaling even planet Venus. But the giant snowball is now so close to the Sun that it can only be seen through the light of the early morning dawn or the early evening dusk. Today, Comet ATLAS is at perihelion -- its closest ever to the Sun.  Although the future brightness of comets is notoriously hard to predict, there is hope that Comet ATLAS will survive its close pass near the Sun and remain bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye over the next few days -- and possibly a good camera comet for weeks.

First, Polaris is the nearest bright star toward the north spin axis of the Earth.  Therefore, as the Earth turns, stars appear to revolve around Polaris, but Polaris itself always stays in the same northerly direction -- making it the North Star.  Since no bright star is near the south spin axis of the Earth, there is currently no bright South Star.  Thousands of years ago, Earth&#x27;s spin axis pointed in a slightly different direction so that Vega was the North Star.  Although Polaris is not the brightest star on the sky, it is easily located because it is nearly aligned with two stars in the cup of the Big Dipper. Polaris is near the center of the five-degree wide featured image, a digital composite of hundreds of exposures that brings out faint gas and dust of the Integrated Flux Nebula (IFN) all over the frame. The surface of Cepheid Polaris slowly pulsates, causing the famous star to change its brightness by a few percent over the course of a few days.

Yes, but only in the sense that it moves in front, which happens on rare occasions.  This happened just yesterday, though, as seen from some locations in North America and western Africa.  This occultation was notable not only because the Moon was a fully lit Wolf Moon, but because Mars was near its largest and brightest, moving to opposition -- the closest to the Earth in its orbit -- only tomorrow.  The engulfing, more formally called an occultation, typically lasts about an hour. The featured image was taken from near Chicago, Illinois, USA just as Earth&#x27;s largest satellite was angularly moving away from the much more distant red planet. Our  Moon occasionally moves in front of all of the Solar System&#x27;s planets.  Given the temporary alignment of orbital planes, the next time our Moon eclipses Mars will be a relatively soon February 9.

Prominent spiral arms traced by dark dust lanes and blue star clusters lend this galaxy its popular name, The Southern Pinwheel.  Still, reddish star forming regions that dot this cosmic pinwheel&#x27;s spiral arms have suggested another nickname, the Thousand-Ruby Galaxy. A mere 40,000 light-years across, smaller than the Milky Way, M83 is a member of a group of galaxies that includes active galaxy Centaurus A. In fact, the core of M83 itself is bright at x-ray energies, showing a high concentration of neutron stars and black holes left from an intense burst of star formation. This sharp color image also features spiky foreground Milky Way stars and distant background galaxies. The image data was captured with the Dark Energy Camera and Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/noirlab2429a.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;M83: The Southern Pinwheel&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/noirlab2429a_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Massive stars in our Milky Way Galaxy live spectacular lives.  Collapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces ignite and create heavy elements in their cores. After only a few million years for the most massive stars, the enriched material is blasted back into interstellar space where star formation can begin anew. The expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example of this final phase of the stellar life cycle. Light from the supernova explosion that created this remnant would have been first seen in planet Earth&#x27;s sky about 350 years ago, although it took that light 11,000 years to reach us. This sharp NIRCam image from the James Webb Space Telescope shows the still hot filaments and knots in the supernova remnant. The whitish, smoke-like outer shell of the expanding blast wave is about 20 light-years across. A series of light echoes from the massive star&#x27;s cataclysmic explosion are also identified in Webb&#x27;s detailed images of the surrounding interstellar medium.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/CasA_nircam_4096.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/CasA_nircam_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;David Bowman&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-18&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On January 13 a Full Moon and a Full Mars were close, both bright and opposite the Sun in planet Earth&#x27;s sky. In fact Mars was occulted, passing behind the Moon, when viewed from some locations in North America and northwest Africa.  As seen from Richmond, Virginia, USA, this composite image sequence follows the evening lunar occultation before, during, and after the much anticipated celestial spectacle. The telescopic time series is constructed from an exposure made every two minutes while tracking the Moon over the hours encompassing the event. As a result, the Red Planet&#x27;s trajectory seems to follow a gently curved path due to the Moon&#x27;s slightly different rate of apparent motion. The next lunar occultation of bright planet Mars will be on February 9 when the moon is in a waxing gibbous phase. Lunar occultations are only ever visible from a fraction of the Earth&#x27;s surface, though. The February 9 occultation of Mars will be seen from parts of Russia, China, eastern Canada, Greenland and other (mostly northern) locations, but a close conjunction of a bright Moon with Mars will be more widely visible from planet Earth.

The European Space Agency&#x27;s Huygens probe set down on the Solar System&#x27;s cloudiest moon in 2005, and a time-lapse video of its descent images was created. Huygens separated from the robotic Cassini spacecraft soon after it achieved orbit around Saturn in late 2004 and began approaching Titan. For two hours after arriving, Huygens plummeted toward Titan&#x27;s surface, recording at first only the shrouded moon&#x27;s opaque atmosphere. The computerized truck-tire sized probe soon deployed a parachute to slow its descent, pierced the thick clouds, and began transmitting images of a strange surface far below never before seen in visible light. Landing in a dried sea and surviving for 90 minutes, Huygen&#x27;s returned unique images of a strange plain of dark sandy soil strewn with smooth, bright, fist-sized rocks of ice.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Titan Touchdown: Huygens Descent Movie&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/msiLWxDayuA?rel&#x3D;0&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why does Comet ATLAS have such colorful tails? Last week Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) passed its closest to the Sun -- well inside the orbit of Mercury -- and brightened dramatically.  Unfortunately, the comet was then so angularly near the Sun that it was very hard for humans to see. But NASA&#x27;s SOHO spacecraft saw it. Pictured is a SOHO (LASCO C3) image of Comet ATLAS that is a composite of several different color filters. Of the several tails visible, the central white tails are likely made of dust and just reflecting back sunlight. The red, blue, and green tails are likely ion tails with their colors dominated by light emitted by specific gases that were ejected from the comet and energized by the Sun.  Currently, Comet ATLAS is showing long tails in southern skies but fading as it moves out of the inner Solar System.

Above the city, above most clouds, far in the distance: it&#x27;s a comet. Pictured, the impressive tail of Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) was imaged from Bras\u00edlia, Brazil four days ago. Last week the evolving  comet rounded the Sun well inside the orbit of planet Mercury, going so close there was early concern that it might break up -- and recent evidence that it really did.  At one point near perihelion, Comet ATLAS was so bright that sightings were even reported during the day -- over the bright sky near the Sun -- by careful observers.  Over the past few days, Comet ATLAS has developed a long tail that has been partly visible with unaided eyes after sunset, most notably in Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere.

The featured image shows the star forming wall lit and eroded by bright young stars and partly hidden by the dark dust they have created.

Both Sombrero and Little Sombrero are spiral galaxies seen edge-on, and both have extensive halos and central bulges cut by a thin disk with thinner dust lanes in silhouette. In fact, NGC 7814 is some 40 million light-years away and an estimated 60,000 light-years across.

C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) has developed several long and intricate tails visible from Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere over the past two weeks. Many observers reported seeing the impressive comet without any optical aid above the western horizon just after sunset. At least six different tails appear in the featured image captured five days ago from the dark skies above Paranal Observatory in Chile.  One possible cause for the multiple tails is dust and gas being expelled from the comet&#x27;s rotating nucleus. The outward push of the Sun&#x27;s complex solar wind may also play a role. The huge iceberg-like nucleus of Comet ATLAS appears to have broken up near its closest approach to the Sun two weeks ago.  Unfortunately, Comet ATLAS and its tails are expected to fade significantly over the coming weeks.    Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

The most famous bunch of stars on the sky is the Pleiades, a bright cluster that can be easily seen with the unaided eye.  The Pleiades lies only about 450 light years away, formed about 100 million years ago, and will likely last about another 250 million years. Our Sun was likely born in a star cluster, but now, being about 4.5 billion years old, its stellar birth companions have long since dispersed. The Pleiades star cluster is pictured over Half Dome, a famous rock structure in Yosemite National Park in California, USA. The featured image is a composite of 28 foreground exposures and 174 images of the stellar background, all taken from the same location and by the same camera on the same night in October 2019.

When far from the Sun, a comet&#x27;s size usually refers to its hard nucleus of ice and rock, which typically spans a few kilometers -- smaller than even a small moon. When nearing the Sun, however, this nucleus can eject dust and gas and leave a thin tail that can spread to an enormous length -- even greater than the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Pictured, C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) sports a tail of sunlight-reflecting dust and glowing gas that spans several times the apparent size of a full moon, appearing even larger on long duration camera images than to the unaided eye. The featured image shows impressive Comet ATLAS over trees and a grass field in Sierras de Mahoma, San Jose, Uruguay about a week ago.  After being prominent in the sunset skies of Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere, Comet G3 ATLAS is now fading as it moves away from the Sun, making its impressive tails increasingly hard to see.

Rich in dust, the rings are likely 3D shells -- but how they were created remains a topic of research.  Where they were created is well known: in a binary star system that lies about 6,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus) -- a system dominated by the Wolf-Rayet star WR 140.  Wolf-Rayet stars are massive, bright, and known for their tumultuous winds. They are also known for creating and dispersing heavy elements such as carbon, which is a building block of interstellar dust. The other star in the binary is also bright and massive -- but not as active.  The two great stars joust in an oblong orbit as they approach each other about every eight years. When at closest approach, the X-ray emission from the system increases, as, apparently, does the dust expelled into space -- creating another shell.  The featured infrared image by the Webb Space Telescope resolves greater details and more dust shells than ever before. Images taken over consecutive years show the shells moving outward.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Wr140Rings_Webb_960_2023.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Dust Shells around WR 140 from Webb&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Wr140Rings_Webb_960_2023.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Pea Mauro&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-30&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Gorgeous spiral galaxy Messier 33 seems to have more than its fair share of glowing hydrogen gas. A prominent member of the Local Group of galaxies, M33 is also known as the Triangulum Galaxy and lies a mere 3 million light-years away.  The galaxy&#x27;s central 60,000 light-years or so are shown in this sharp galaxy portrait. The portrait features M33&#x27;s reddish ionized hydrogen clouds or HII regions. Sprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core, M33&#x27;s giant HII regions are some of the largest known stellar nurseries, sites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars. Intense ultraviolet radiation from the luminous, massive stars ionizes the surrounding hydrogen gas and ultimately produces the characteristic red glow. In this image, broadband data were combined with narrowband data recorded through a filter that transmits the light of the strongest visible hydrogen and oxygen emission lines.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/M33_2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Hydrogen Clouds of M33&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/M33_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Tommy Lease&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-31&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The interstellar cloud of dust and gas captured in this sharp telescopic snapshot is seen to change its appearance noticeably over periods as short as a few weeks. Discovered over 200 years ago and cataloged as NGC 2261, bright star R Monocerotis lies at the tip of the fan-shaped nebula. About one light-year across and 2500 light-years away, NGC 2261 was studied early last century by astronomer Edwin Hubble and the mysterious cosmic cloud is now more famous as Hubble&#x27;s Variable Nebula. So what makes Hubble&#x27;s nebula vary? NGC 2261 is composed of a dusty reflection nebula fanning out from the star R Monocerotis.  The leading variability explanation holds that dense knots of obscuring dust pass close to R Mon and cast moving shadows across the dust clouds in the rest of Hubble&#x27;s Variable Nebula.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/HubblesVariablecopy.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Variable Nebula NGC 2261&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/HubblesVariablecopy1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Vojan H\u00f6fer&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-01&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Vivid and lustrous, wafting iridescent waves of color wash across this skyscape from northern Sweden. Known as nacreous clouds or mother-of-pearl clouds, they are rare. But their unforgettable appearance was captured in this snapshot on January 12 with the Sun just below the local horizon. A type of polar stratospheric cloud, they form when unusually cold temperatures in the usually cloudless lower stratosphere form ice crystals. Still sunlit at altitudes of around 15 to 25 kilometers, the clouds diffract the sunlight even when the Sun itself is hidden from direct view.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/IMG_0340-Internet-2.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nacreous Clouds over Sweden&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/IMG_0340-Internet-2_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What&#x27;s happening to Comet G3 ATLAS? After passing near the Sun in mid-January, the head of the comet has become dimmer and dimmer. By late January, Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) had become a headless wonder -- even though it continued to show impressive tails after sunset in the skies of Earth&#x27;s Southern Hemisphere. Pictured are images of Comet G3 ATLAS on successive January nights taken from R\u00edo Hurtado, Chile. Clearly, the comet&#x27;s head is brighter and more centrally condensed on the earlier days (left) than on later days (right).  A key reason is likely that the comet&#x27;s nucleus of ice and rock, at the head&#x27;s center, has fragmented. Comet G3 ATLAS passed well inside the orbit of planet Mercury when at its solar closest, a distance that where heat destroys many comets.  Some of comet G3 ATLAS&#x27; scattering remains will continue to orbit the Sun.

Rare, massive Wolf-Rayet stars are so tumultuous and hot that they are slowly disintegrating right before our telescopes.  Glowing gas globs each typically over 30 times more massive than the Earth are being expelled by violent stellar winds.  Wolf-Rayet star WR 124, visible near the featured image center, is thus creating the surrounding nebula known as M1-67, which spans six light years across. Details of why this star has been slowly blowing itself apart over the past 20,000 years remains a topic of research.  WR 124 lies 15,000 light-years away towards the constellation of the Arrow (Sagitta).  The fate of any given Wolf-Rayet star likely depends on how massive it is, but many are thought to end their lives with spectacular explosions such as supernovas or gamma-ray bursts.

Late in the day, the Sun set as usual toward the west. However, on this day, the more interesting display was 180 degrees around -- toward the east. There, not only was a rainbow visible, but an impressive display of anticrepuscular rays from the rainbow&#x27;s center. In the featured image from Lekeitio in northern Spain, the Sun is behind the camera. The rainbow resulted from sunlight reflecting back from falling rain. Anticrepuscular rays result from sunlight, blocked by some clouds, going all the way around the sky, overhead, and appearing to converge on the opposite horizon -- an optical illusion.  Rainbows by themselves can be exciting to see, and anticrepuscular rays a rare treat, but capturing them both together is even more unusual -- and can look both serene and surreal.

In the featured time-lapse video, the comet is not itself moving very much, but the Earth&#x27;s rotation makes it appear to be setting over a hill. The Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) sequence was captured with an ordinary camera on January 22 from the Araucan\u00eda Region in central Chile. Comet ATLAS has been an impressive site in the evening skies of Earth&#x27;s Southern Hemisphere over the past few weeks, so bright and awe-inspiring that it may eventually become known as the Great Comet of 2025. Unfortunately, Comet G3 ATLAS is not going anywhere anymore because its central nucleus broke up during its close pass to the Sun last month. Some of the comet&#x27;s scattered remains of rocks and ice will continue to orbit the Sun, some in nearly the same outward section of the orbit that the comet&#x27;s nucleus would have taken.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Comet G3 ATLAS Setting over a Chilean Hill\n&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nt5j0NiVesQ&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Lorand Fenyes&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Grand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the glory, flaunting their young, bright, blue star clusters in beautiful, symmetric spiral arms. But small, irregular galaxies form stars too. In fact dwarf galaxy IC 2574 shows clear evidence of intense star forming activity in its telltale reddish regions of glowing hydrogen gas. Just as in spiral galaxies, the turbulent star-forming regions in IC 2574 are churned by stellar winds and supernova explosions spewing material into the galaxy&#x27;s interstellar medium and triggering further star formation. A mere 12 million light-years distant, IC 2574 is part of the M81 group of galaxies, seen toward the northern constellation Ursa Major.

Its remarkable appearance in this recently released Hubble Space Telescope image strongly suggests its nickname \&quot;The Bullseye Galaxy\&quot;. Known as a collisional ring galaxy it has nine rings confirmed by telescopic observations, rippling from its center like waves from a pebble dropped into a pond. Of course, the pebble dropped into the Bullseye galaxy was a galaxy itself. Telescopic observations identify the blue dwarf galaxy at center-left as the likely collider, passing through the giant galaxy&#x27;s center and forming concentric rings in the wake of their gravitational interaction. The Bullseye Galaxy lies some 567 million light-years away toward the constellation Pisces.

However, the aurora only looked like a hummingbird through a sensitive camera able to pick up faint glows. As reds typically occurring higher in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere than the greens, the real 3D shape of this aurora would likely appear unfamiliar.

New clues have been found in the protoplanetary system Herbig-Haro 30 by the James Webb Space Telescope in concert with Hubble and the Earth-bound ALMA.  The observations show, among other things, that large dust grains are more concentrated into a central disk where they can form planets. The featured image from Webb shows many attributes of the active HH-30 system. Jets of particles are being expelled vertically, shown in red, while a dark dust-rich disk is seen across the center, blocking the light from the star or stars still forming there. Blue-reflecting dust is seen in a parabolic arc above and below the central disk, although why a tail appears on the lower left is currently unknown. Studying how planets form in HH 30 can help astronomers better understand how planets in our own Solar System once formed, including our Earth.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/HH30_Webb_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;HH 30: A Star System with Planets Now Forming&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/HH30_Webb_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;rmous elliptical galaxy Messier 87 is about 50 million light-years away. Also known as NGC 4486, the giant galaxy holds trillions of stars compared to the mere billions of stars in our large spiral Milky Way. M87 reigns as the large central elliptical galaxy in the Virgo galaxy cluster. An energetic jet from the giant galaxy&#x27;s core is seen to stretch outward for about 5,000 light-years in this sharp optical and near-infrared view from the Hubble Space Telescope. In fact, the cosmic blow torch is seen across the electromagnetic spectrum from gamma-rays to radio wavelengths. Its ultimate power source is M87&#x27;s central, supermassive black hole.

With 600 overlapping frames assembled from observations made from July 2010 to December 2022, the full Hubble Andromeda Galaxy mosaic spans almost six full moons across planet Earth&#x27;s sky. A cropped version shown above is nearly two full moons across and partially covers Andromeda&#x27;s core and inner spiral arms. Also known as M31, the Andromeda Galaxy is 2.5 million light-years away. That makes it the closest large spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way. Our perspective on the spiral Milky Way is anchored to the view from the location of the Sun, a star found within the Milky Way&#x27;s galactic disk. But Hubble&#x27;s magnificent Andromeda mosaic offers an expansive view of a large spiral galaxy from the outside looking in.

Easy to spot in telescopic views of the Moon, it stretches top left to bottom right across this lunar closeup. The image was made with exaggerated colors that reflect the mineral composition of the lunar soil. Hyginus crater lies near the center of the narrow lunar surface groove. About 10 kilometers in diameter, the low-walled crater is a volcanic caldera, one of the larger non-impact craters on the lunar surface. Dotted with small pits formed by surface collapse, Hyginus rima itself was likely created by stresses due to internal magma upwelling and collapse along a long surface fault. The intriguing region was a candidate landing site for the canceled Apollo 19 mission.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/20250205_rima_hyginus_mirabella_1500px.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rima Hyginus&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/20250205_rima_hyginus_mirabella_1024px.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Saturn looks slightly different in infrared light. Bands of clouds show great structure, including long stretching storms.  Also quite striking in infrared is the unusual hexagonal cloud pattern surrounding Saturn&#x27;s North Pole.  Each side of the dark hexagon spans roughly the width of our Earth. The hexagon&#x27;s existence was not predicted, and its origin and likely stability remain a topics of research.  Saturn&#x27;s famous rings circle the planet and cast shadows below the equator. The featured image was taken by the robotic Cassini spacecraft in 2014 in several infrared colors.  In 2017 September, the Cassini mission was brought to a dramatic conclusion when the spacecraft was  directed to dive into the ringed giant.

No, but light from the lava flow can. One effect is something quite unusual -- a volcanic light pillar. More typically, light pillars are caused by sunlight and so appear as a bright column that extends upward above a rising or setting Sun. Alternatively, other light pillars -- some quite colorful -- have been recorded above street and house lights. This light pillar, though, was illuminated by the red light emitted by the glowing magma of an erupting volcano. The volcano is Italy&#x27;s Mount Etna, and the featured image was captured with a single shot during an early morning in mid-February. Freezing temperatures above the volcano&#x27;s lava flow created ice-crystals either in the air above the volcano or in condensed water vapor expelled by Mount Etna. These ice crystals -- mostly flat toward the ground but fluttering -- then reflected away light from the volcano&#x27;s caldera.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/LightPillarVolcano_Calio_1333.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Light Pillar over Erupting Etna&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/LightPillarVolcano_Calio_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nXinran Li\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why are there so many bright blue stars?  Stars are usually born in clusters, and the brightest and most massive of these stars typically glow blue. Less-bright, non-blue stars like our Sun surely also exist in this M41 star cluster but are harder to see. A few bright orange-appearing red giant stars are visible. The red-light filaments are emitted by diffuse hydrogen gas, a color that was specifically filtered and enhanced in this image.  In a hundred million years or so, the bright blue stars will have exploded in supernovas and disappeared, while the slightly different trajectories of the fainter stars will cause this picturesque open cluster to disperse. Similarly, billions of years ago, our own Sun was likely born into a star cluster like M41, but it has long since drifted apart from its sister stars.

It is the gravity of NGC 6505, the nearby (z &#x3D; 0.042) elliptical galaxy that you can easily see, that is magnifying and distorting the image of a distant galaxy into a complete circle. To create a complete Einstein ring there must be perfect alignment of the nearby galaxy&#x27;s center and part of the background galaxy. Analysis of this ring and the multiple images of the background galaxy help to determine the mass and fraction of dark matter in NGC 6505&#x27;s center, as well as uncover previously unseen details in the distorted galaxy.

Located within the boundaries of the constellation Gemini, they do appear to be side by side. Its stars concentrated toward the upper right, M35 is relatively nearby, though. M35 (also cataloged as NGC 2168) is a mere 2800 light-years distant, with 400 or so stars spread out over a volume about 30 light-years across. Bright blue stars frequently distinguish younger open clusters like M35, whose age is estimated at 150 million years. At lower left, NGC 2158 is about four times more distant than M35 and much more compact, shining with the more yellowish light of a population of stars over 10 times older. In general, open star clusters are found along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy.

Either way, you&#x27;ve likely not heard about it like this -- please run your cursor over the featured image and listen!  The Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) was created in 2003-2004 with the Hubble Space Telescope staring for a long time toward near-empty space so that distant, faint galaxies would become visible.  One of the most famous images in astronomy, the HUDF is featured here in a vibrant way -- with sonified distances. Pointing to a galaxy will play a note that indicates its approximate redshift. Because redshifts shift light toward the red end of the spectrum of light, they are depicted here by a shift of tone toward the low end of the spectrum of sound.  The further the galaxy, the greater its cosmological redshift (even if it appears blue), and the lower the tone that will be played. The average galaxy in the HUDF is about 10.6 billion light years away and sounds like an F#.

Yesterday Firefly Aerospace&#x27;s Blue Ghost executed the first-ever successful commercial lunar landing. During its planned 60-day mission, Blue Ghost will deploy several NASA-commissioned scientific instruments, including PlanetVac which captures lunar dust after creating a small whirlwind of gas. Blue Ghost will also host the telescope LEXI that captures X-ray images of the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. LEXI data should enable a better understanding of how Earth&#x27;s magnetic field protects the Earth from the Sun&#x27;s wind and flares.

A key reason is its vivid red color. The color is caused by the deflection of blue light by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere -- the same reason that the daytime sky appears blue.  The Moon also appears unusually distorted.  Its strange structuring is an optical effect arising from layers in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere that refract light differently due to sudden differences in temperature or pressure.  A third reason the Moon looks so unusual is that there is, by chance, an airplane flying in front. The featured picturesque gibbous Moon was captured about two weeks ago above Turin, Italy. Our familiar hovering sky orb was part of an unusual quadruple alignment that included two historic ground structures: the Sacra di San Michele on the near hill and Basilica of Superga just beyond.

The sharp close-up examines the galaxy&#x27;s compact, bright nucleus and prominent inner dust lanes, surrounded by a remarkable bluish ring of young, massive stars. The massive stars in the ring appear to be less than about 10 million years old, indicating the galaxy experienced a corresponding well-defined era of rapid star formation. As a result, while the small, bright nucleus is typical of the Seyfert class of active galaxies, M94 is also known as a starburst galaxy.

They reveal eight cyclonic features that surround a cyclone about 4,000 kilometers in diameter, just offset from the giant planet&#x27;s geographic north pole. Similar data show a cyclone at the Jovian south pole with five circumpolar cyclones. The south pole cyclones are slightly larger than their northern cousins.

Even our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a modest central bar. Prominently barred spiral galaxy NGC 1672, featured here, was captured in spectacular detail in an image taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. Visible are dark filamentary dust lanes, young clusters of bright blue stars, red emission nebulas of glowing hydrogen gas, a long bright bar of stars across the center, and a bright active nucleus that likely houses a supermassive black hole.  Light takes about 60 million years to reach us from NGC 1672, which spans about 75,000 light years across. NGC 1672, which appears toward the constellation of the Dolphinfish (Dorado), has been studied to find out how a spiral bar contributes to star formation in a galaxy&#x27;s central regions.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/NGC1672B_Hubble_4000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 1672: Barred Spiral Galaxy from Hubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/NGC1672B_Hubble_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Bax &amp; Serge Brunier,  \nOCA/C2PU; \nText: \nOgetay Kayali \n(Michigan Tech U.)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-12&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why does this galaxy look like a curly vegetable?  The Fiddlehead spiral galaxy likely gets its distorted spiral appearance from a gravitational interaction with its close-by elliptical companion NGC 770, seen just below.  Cataloged as NGC 772 and Arp 78, the Fiddlehead spans over 200,000 light years, is a nearby 100 million light years beyond the stars of our Milky Way galaxy, and is visible toward the constellation of the Ram (Aries).  But in the featured image, the Fiddlehead appears to have another companion -- one with a long and fuzzy tail: Comet 43P/Wolf-Harrington.  Though the comet appears to be aimed straight at the massive galaxy, it is actually much closer to us, residing only light minutes away -- well within our Solar System.  The comet will never reach the distant spiral galaxy, nor is it physically related to it.  By a fortunate trick of perspective, though, these two cosmic wonders briefly share the same frame taken late last year from Calern, France.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/NGC772Comet_Bax_4724.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 772: The Fiddlehead Galaxy&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/NGC772Comet_Bax_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-13&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Two protostars are hidden in a single pixel near the center of a striking hourglass-shaped nebula in this near-infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope. The actively forming star system lies in a dusty molecular cloud cataloged as Lynds 483, some 650 light-years distant toward the constellation Serpens Cauda. Responsible for the stunning bipolar outflows, the collapsing protostars have been blasting out collimated energetic jets of material over tens of thousands of years. Webb&#x27;s high-resolution view shows the violence of star-formation in dramatic detail as twisting shock fronts expand and collide with slower, denser material.

The Full Moon, of course. Even though the Moon might look full for several days, the Moon is truly at its full phase when it is Pi radians (aka 180 degrees) from the Sun in ecliptic longitude. That&#x27;s opposite the Sun in planet Earth&#x27;s sky. Rising as the Sun set on March 9, 2020, only an hour or so after the moment of its full phase, this orange tinted and slightly flattened Moon still looked full. It was photographed opposite the setting Sun from Teide National Park on the Canary Island of Tenerife. Also opposite the setting Sun, seen from near the Teide volcano peak about 3,500 meters above sea level, is the mountain&#x27;s rising triangular shadow extending into Earth&#x27;s dense atmosphere. Below the distant ridge line on the left are the white telescope domes of Teide Observatory. Today, March 14 2025, the moon is Pi radians from the Sun at exactly 06:55 UTC. That&#x27;s about three minutes before the midpoint of the March Full Moon&#x27;s total lunar eclipse.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/MoonriseShadowDLopez_1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Moon Pi and Mountain Shadow&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/MoonriseShadowDLopez_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Petr Hor\u00e1lek&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-15&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On March 14 the Moon was Full. In an appropriate celebration of Pi day, that put the Moon 3.14 radians (180 degrees) in ecliptic longitude from the Sun in planet Earth&#x27;s sky. As a bonus for fans of Pi and the night sky, on that date the Moon also passed directly through Earth&#x27;s umbral shadow in a total lunar eclipse. In clear skies, the colors of an eclipsed Moon can be vivid. Reflecting the deeply reddened sunlight scattered into Earth&#x27;s shadow, the darkened lunar disk was recorded in this time series composite image from Cerro Tololo Observatory, Chile. The lunar triptych captures the start, middle, and end of the total eclipse phase that lasted about an hour. A faint bluish tint seen just along the brighter lunar limb at the shadow&#x27;s edge is due to sunlight filtered through Earth&#x27;s stratospheric ozone layer.

Typically, it is the Earth&#x27;s Moon that eclipses the Sun.  In 2012, though, the planet Venus took a turn.  Like a solar eclipse by the Moon, the phase of Venus became a continually thinner crescent as Venus became increasingly better aligned with the Sun.  Eventually the alignment became perfect and the phase of Venus dropped to zero.  The dark spot of Venus crossed our parent star.  The situation could technically be labeled a Venusian annular eclipse with an extraordinarily large ring of fire.  Pictured here during the occultation, the Sun was imaged in three colors of ultraviolet light by the Earth-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory, with the dark region toward the right corresponding to a coronal hole. Hours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, a slight crescent phase appeared again.  The next Venusian transit across the Sun will occur in 2117.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/SunVenusUv3_SdoDove_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Venus and the Triply Ultraviolet Sun&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/SunVenusUv3_SdoDove_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nBrian Hopkins \n(East Coast Astronomer)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Thor not only has his own day (Thursday), but a helmet in the heavens.  Popularly called Thor&#x27;s Helmet, NGC 2359 is a hat-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages. Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor&#x27;s Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the cosmic head-covering is more like an interstellar bubble, blown by a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble&#x27;s center. Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution. NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away toward the constellation of the Great Overdog. This sharp image is a mixed cocktail of data from  narrowband filters, capturing not only natural looking stars but details of the nebula&#x27;s filamentary structures. The star in the center of Thor&#x27;s Helmet is expected to explode in a spectacular supernova sometime within the next few thousand years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/ThorHelmet_Hopkins_3888.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Thor&#x27;s Helmet&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/ThorHelmet_Hopkins_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nTimothy Martin\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-18&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;There is no sea on Earth large enough to contain the Shark nebula. This predator apparition poses us no danger as it is composed only of interstellar gas and dust. Dark dust like that featured here is somewhat like cigarette smoke and created in the cool atmospheres of giant stars. After expelling gas and gravitationally recondensing, massive stars may carve intricate structures into their birth cloud using their high energy light and fast stellar winds as sculpting tools.  The heat they generate evaporates the murky molecular cloud as well as causing ambient hydrogen gas to disperse and glow red.  During disintegration, we humans can enjoy imagining these great clouds as common icons, like we do for water clouds on Earth. Including smaller dust nebulae such as Van den Bergh 149 &amp; 150, the Shark nebula, sometimes cataloged as LDN 1235,  spans about 15 light years and lies about 650 light years away toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia (Cepheus).

Of course, from the Moon&#x27;s near side that same astronomical syzygy was seen as a solar eclipse. Operating in the Mare Crisium on the lunar surface, the Blue Ghost lander captured this video frame of Earth in silhouette around 3:30am CDT, just as the Sun was emerging from behind the terrestrial disk. From Blue Ghost&#x27;s lunar perspective the beautiful diamond ring effect, familiar to earthbound solar eclipse watchers, is striking. Since Earth appears about four times the apparent size of the Sun from the lunar surface the inner solar corona, the atmosphere of the Sun most easily seen from Earth during a total solar eclipse, is hidden from view. Still, scattering in Earth&#x27;s dense atmosphere creates the glowing band of sunlight embracing our fair planet.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/eclipse-shot-from-blue-ghost-mission-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blue Ghost&#x27;s Diamond Ring&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/eclipse-shot-from-blue-ghost-crop1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Hunter Wells&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Recorded from 2024 March 10, to 2025 March 1, this composited series of images reveals a pattern in the seasonal drift of the Sun&#x27;s daily motion through planet Earth&#x27;s sky.

The Sun&#x27;s position on the 2024 solstice dates of June 20 and December 21 would be at the top and bottom of the curve and correspond to the astronomical beginning of summer and winter in the north. Points that lie along the curve half-way between the solstices would mark the equinoxes. The 2024 equinox on September 22, and in 2025 the equinox on March 20 (today) are the start of northern fall and spring. And since one of the exposures was made on 2024 April 8 from the Stephenville location at 18:38:40 UTC, this analemma project also reveals the solar corona in planet Earth&#x27;s sky during a total solar eclipse.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/HunterWells_submission3-3.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Solar Eclipse Analemma Project&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/HunterWells_submission3-3labelled1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Rabeea Alkuwari&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This popular group leaps into the early evening sky around the March equinox and the northern hemisphere spring.  Famous as the Leo Triplet, the three magnificent galaxies found in the prominent constellation Leo gather here in one astronomical field of view. Crowd pleasers when imaged with even modest telescopes, they can be introduced individually as NGC 3628 (bottom left), M66 (middle right), and M65 (top center). All three are large spiral galaxies but tend to look dissimilar, because their galactic disks are tilted at different angles to our line of sight. NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy, is temptingly seen edge-on, with obscuring dust lanes cutting across its puffy galactic plane. The disks of M66 and M65 are both inclined enough to show off their spiral structure.  Gravitational interactions between galaxies in the group have left telltale signs, including the tidal tails and warped, inflated disk of NGC 3628 and the drawn out spiral arms of M66. This gorgeous view of the region spans over 1 degree (two full moons) on the sky.

There&#x27;s no need to consult a Zen master to find out, just listen to the first acoustic recording of laser shots on Mars. On Mars Rover Perseverance mission sol 12 (March 2, 2021) the SuperCam instrument atop the rover&#x27;s mast zapped a rock dubbed Ma&#x27;az 30 times from a range of about 3.1 meters. Its microphone recorded the soft staccato popping sounds of the rapid series of SuperCam laser zaps. Shockwaves created in the thin Martian atmosphere as bits of rock are vaporized by the laser shots make the popping sounds, sounds that offer clues to the physical structure of the target. This SuperCam close-up of the Ma&#x27;az target region is 6 centimeters (2.3 inches) across.

The featured 360-degree panorama, horizontally compressed, was taken in 2017 by the robotic Curiosity rover that explored the red planet. Named Ogunquit Beach after its terrestrial counterpart, evidence shows that at times long ago the area was underwater, while at other times it was at the edge of an ancient lake.  The light peak in the central background is the top of Mount Sharp, the central feature in Gale Crater where Curiosity explored. Portions of the dark sands in the foreground were  scooped up for analysis.  The light colored bedrock is composed of sediment that likely settled at the bottom of the now-dried lakebed.

The answer was recorded in a dramatic time lapse video taken during the total lunar eclipse last week from Uruguay. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, causing the Moon to fade dramatically. The Moon never gets completely dark, though, since the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere refracts some light. As the featured video begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon. As the Moon becomes eclipsed and fades, background stars become visible. Most spectacularly, the sky surrounding the eclipsed moon suddenly appears to be full of stars and highlighted by the busy plane of our Milky Way Galaxy. Nearly two hours after the eclipse started, the Moon emerged from the Earth&#x27;s shadow and its bright full glare again dominated the sky.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;other&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Total Lunar Eclipse Over Uruguay&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nZixiong Jin\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What causes a blue band to cross the Moon during a lunar eclipse? The blue band is real but usually quite hard to see. The featured HDR image of last week&#x27;s lunar eclipse, however -- taken from Norman, Oklahoma (USA) -- has been digitally processed to exaggerate  the colors.  The gray color on the upper right of the top lunar image is the Moon&#x27;s natural color, directly illuminated by sunlight. The lower parts of the Moon on all three images are not directly lit by the Sun since it is being eclipsed -- it is in the Earth&#x27;s shadow. It is faintly lit, though, by sunlight that has passed deep through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. This part of the Moon is red -- and called a blood Moon -- for the same reason that Earth&#x27;s sunsets are red: because air scatters away more blue light than red. The unusual purple-blue band visible on the upper right of the top and middle images is different -- its color is augmented by sunlight that has passed high through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, where red light is better absorbed by ozone than blue.

The eye-catching shapes looming in the featured portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense Bok globules seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and radiation from the hot cluster stars. If they survive long enough, the dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation. Playfully called the Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. This sharp composite image was made through narrow-band filters in Spain in mid 2024. It combines emissions from the nebula&#x27;s hydrogen and oxygen atoms to synthesize red, green, and blue colors.

The sharp, detailed telescopic view reveals M81&#x27;s bright yellow nucleus, blue spiral arms, pinkish starforming regions, and sweeping cosmic dust lanes. But some dust lanes actually cut across the galactic disk (left of center), contrary to other prominent spiral features. The errant dust lanes may be the lingering result of a close encounter between M81 and the nearby galaxy M82 lurking outside of this frame.

On Earth, rocks are weathered by wind and water, creating soil and sand. On the Moon, eons of constant micrometeorite bombardment have blasted away at the rocky surface creating a layer of powdery lunar soil or regolith.  For the Apollo astronauts and their equipment, the pervasive, fine, gritty dust was definitely a problem. On the lunar surface in December 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan needed to repair one of their rover&#x27;s fenders in an effort to keep the rooster tails of dust away from themselves and their gear.

Appropriately named, Helene is a Trojan moon, so called because it orbits at a Lagrange point. A Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position near two massive bodies, in this case Saturn and larger moon Dione. In fact, irregularly shaped ( about 36 by 32 by 30 kilometers) Helene orbits at Dione&#x27;s leading Lagrange point while brotherly ice moon Polydeuces follows at Dione&#x27;s trailing Lagrange point.

That happened yesterday over some northern parts of planet Earth as a partial solar eclipse occurred shortly after sunrise. Regions that experienced the Moon blocking part of the Sun included northeastern parts of North America and northwestern parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa.  The featured image was captured yesterday over the Gr\u00e1br\u00f3k volcanic crater in Iceland where much of the Sun became momentarily hidden behind the Moon. The image was taken through a cloudy sky but so well planned that the photographer&#x27;s friend appeared to be pulling the Sun out from behind the Moon. No part of the Earth experienced a total solar eclipse this time. In the distant past, some of humanity was so surprised when an eclipse occurred that ongoing battles suddenly stopped.  Today, eclipses are not a surprise and are predicted with an accuracy of seconds.

This was just the case a few days ago from Les Escoumins, Quebec, Canada as our Solar System&#x27;s bright central orb rose just as it was being partially eclipsed by the Moon. The featured video shows this unusual double-sunrise in real time and being reflected by the St. Lawrence River. Soon after the initial two spots of light appear over distant clouds, what appears to be bright horns become visible -- which are really just parts of the Sun not being eclipsed. Soon, the entire eclipsed Sun is visible above the horizon.  In all, this broken sunrise took less than two minutes during a partial eclipse that lasted many times longer.   Although the Moon circles the Earth once a month (moon-th), it does not always eclipse the Sun because its tilted orbit usually takes it above or below.

Jupiter&#x27;s main ring was discovered in 1979 by NASA&#x27;s passing Voyager 1 spacecraft, but its origin was then a mystery.  Data from NASA&#x27;s Galileo spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, however, confirmed the hypothesis that this ring was created by meteoroid impacts on small nearby moons.  As a small meteoroid strikes tiny Metis, for example, it will bore into the moon, vaporize, and explode dirt and dust off into a Jovian orbit. The featured image of Jupiter in infrared light by the James Webb Space Telescope shows not only Jupiter and its clouds, but this ring as well. Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot (GRS) -- in comparatively light color on the right, Jupiter&#x27;s large moon Europa -- in the center of diffraction spikes on the left, and Europa&#x27;s shadow -- next to the GRS -- are also visible. Several features in the image are not yet well understood, including the seemingly separated cloud layer on Jupiter&#x27;s right limb.

The one second long exposure was captured near moonset on March 30. And while only a a sliver of its sunlit surface is visible, most of the Moon&#x27;s disk can be seen by earthshine as light reflected from a bright planet Earth illuminates the lunar nearside. Also known as the Moon&#x27;s ashen glow, a description of earthshine in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth&#x27;s oceans illuminating the Moon&#x27;s dark surface was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci. Of course earthshine is just the most familiar example of planetshine, the faint illumination of the dark portion of a moon by light reflected from its planet.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/GHR5997Luna1giornofirmapicc.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Da Vinci Glow&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/GHR5997Luna1giornofirmapicc1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Jiang Wu&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Scanning the skies for galaxies, Canadian astronomer Paul Hickson and colleagues identified some 100 compact groups of galaxies, now appropriately called Hickson Compact Groups. The four prominent galaxies seen in this intriguing telescopic skyscape are one such group, Hickson 44. The galaxy group is about 100 million light-years distant, far beyond the spiky foreground Milky Way stars, toward the constellation Leo. The two spiral galaxies in the center of the image are edge-on NGC 3190 with its distinctive, warped dust lanes, and S-shaped NGC 3187. Along with the bright elliptical, NGC 3193 (above and left) they are also known as Arp 316. The spiral toward the lower right corner is NGC 3185, the 4th member of the Hickson group. Like other galaxies in Hickson groups, these show signs of distortion and enhanced star formation, evidence of a gravitational tug of war that will eventually result in galaxy mergers on a cosmic timescale. The merger process is now understood to be a normal part of the evolution of galaxies, including our own Milky Way. For scale, NGC 3190 is about 75,000 light-years across at the estimated distance of Hickson 44.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/ARP316.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Hickson 44 in Leo&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/ARP316_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Bertrand Kulik&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-05&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;In dramatic silhouette against a cloudy daytime sky over Paris, France, gargoyles cast their monstrous gaze outward from the west facade of Notre Dame Cathedral.

Happening high in Parisian skies, the partial eclipse was close to its maximum phase of about 23 percent. Occurring near the end of the first eclipse season of 2025, this partial solar eclipse followed the total eclipse of the Full Moon on March 13/14. The upcoming second eclipse season of 2025 will see a total lunar eclipse on September 7/8 and partial solar eclipse on September 21. The partial solar eclipse will be seen only from locations in planet Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/NDGargoylesEclipse_kulik.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Gargoyles&#x27; Eclipse&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/NDGargoylesEclipse_kulik.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why are there so many moonquakes?   Analyses of seismometers left on the moon during the Apollo moon landings reveal a surprising number of moonquakes occurring within 100 kilometers of the surface.   In fact, 62 moonquakes were detected in data recorded between 1972 and 1977.   Many of these moonquakes are not only strong enough to move furniture in a lunar apartment, but the stiff rock of the moon continues to vibrate for many minutes, significantly longer than the softer rock earthquakes on Earth.   The cause of the moonquakes remains unknown, but a leading hypothesis includes tidal gravity from -- and relative heating by -- our Earth. Regardless of the source, future moon dwellings need to be built to withstand the frequent shakings.

The featured image of flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 4414 was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope to help answer this question. Flocculent spirals -- galaxies without well-defined spiral arms -- are a quite common form of galaxy, and NGC 4414 is one of the closest.  Stars and gas near the visible edge of spiral galaxies orbit the center so fast that the gravity from a large amount of unseen dark matter must be present to hold them together.  Understanding the matter and dark matter distribution of NGC 4414 helps humanity calibrate the rest of the galaxy and, by deduction, flocculent spirals in general.  Further, calibrating the distance to NGC 4414 helps  humanity calibrate the cosmological distance scale of the entire  visible universe.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Ngc4414B_Hubble_1280.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 4414: A Flocculent Spiral Galaxy&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Ngc4414B_Hubble_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Sometimes, the Moon visits the Pleiades. Technically, this means that the orbit of our Moon takes it directly in front of the famous Pleiades star cluster, which is far in the distance.  The technical term for the event is an occultation, and the Moon is famous for its rare occultations of all planets and several well-known bright stars. The Moon&#x27;s tilted and precessing orbit makes its occultations of the Seven Sisters star cluster bunchy, with the current epoch starting in 2023 continuing monthly until 2029. After that, though, the next occultation won&#x27;t occur until 2042.  Taken from Cantabria, Spain on April 1, the featured image is a composite where previous exposures of the Pleiades from the same camera and location were digitally added to the last image to bring up the star cluster&#x27;s iconic blue glow.

First let&#x27;s consider the jet: it is being expelled by a star system just forming and is cataloged as Herbig-Haro 49 (HH 49).  The star system expelling this jet is not visible -- it is off to the lower right.  The complex conical structure featured in this infrared image by the James Webb Space Telescope also includes another jet cataloged as HH 50.  The fast jet particles impact the surrounding interstellar gas and form shock waves that glow prominently in infrared light -- shown here as reddish-brown ridges.  This JWST image also resolved the mystery of the unusual object at HH 49&#x27;s tip: it is a spiral galaxy far in the distance.  The blue center is therefore not one star but many, and the surrounding circular rings are actually spiral arms.

In fact, the group&#x27;s dominant galaxy M81 is near the center of the frame sporting grand spiral arms and a bright yellow core. Also known as Bode&#x27;s galaxy, M81 itself spans some 100,000 light-years. Near the top is cigar-shaped irregular galaxy M82.  The pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years. Gravity from each galaxy has profoundly affected the other during a series of cosmic close encounters.  Their last go-round lasted about 100 million years and likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in massive star forming regions arrayed along M81&#x27;s spiral arms.  M82 was left with violent star forming regions too, and colliding gas clouds so energetic that the galaxy glows in X-rays.  In the next few billion years, their continuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a single galaxy will remain. Another group member, NGC 3077 is below and left of the large spiral M81. Far far away, about 12 million light-years distant the M81 group galaxies are seen toward the northern constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear).

In close conjunction with the bright planet, the faint outline of the orbital outpost seen at a range of about 400 kilometers appears to be similar in size to the slender planetary crescent.

But the Moon spends nearly as many daylight hours above our horizon, though in bright daytime skies the lunar disk looks pale and can be a little harder to see. Of course in daytime skies the Moon also appears to cycle through its phases, shining by reflected sunlight as it orbits our fair planet. For daytime moonwatchers, the Moon is probably easier to spot when the visible sunlit portion of the lunar disk is large and waxing following first quarter or waning approaching its third quarter phase. And though it might look unusual, a daytime moon is often seen even in urban skies. Captured here in a telephoto snapshot taken on March 12, a waxing daytime Moon is aligned near the edge of a popular observation deck that overlooks New York City&#x27;s borough of Manahattan.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/PlataformaRecorteHorizontalRedes.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Moon Near the Edge&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/PlataformaRecorteHorizontalRedes1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-13&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What created this unusual hole in Mars? Actually, there are numerous holes pictured in this Swiss cheese-like landscape, with all-but-one of them showing a dusty, dark, Martian terrain beneath evaporating, light, carbon dioxide ice.  The most unusual hole is on the upper right, spans about 100 meters, and seems to punch through to a lower level. Why this hole exists and why it is surrounded by a circular crater remains a topic of speculation, although a leading hypothesis is that it was created by a meteor impact.  Holes such as this are of particular interest because they might be portals to lower levels that extend into expansive underground caves. If so, these naturally occurring tunnels are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life. These pits are therefore also prime targets for possible future spacecraft, robots, and even human interplanetary explorers.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/MarsPit_mro_2628.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;An Unusual Hole in Mars&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/MarsPit_mro_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-14&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What&#x27;s happening at the center of our galaxy? It&#x27;s hard to tell with optical telescopes since visible light is blocked by intervening interstellar dust. In other bands of light, though, such as radio, the galactic center can be imaged and shows itself to be quite an interesting and active place.  The featured picture shows an image of our Milky Way&#x27;s center by the MeerKAT array of 64 radio dishes in South Africa. Spanning four times the angular size of the Moon (2 degrees), the image is impressively vast, deep, and detailed.  Many known sources are shown in clear detail, including many with a prefix of Sgr, since the galactic center is in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.  In our galaxy&#x27;s center lies Sgr A, found here in the image center, which houses the Milky Way&#x27;s central supermassive black hole.  Other sources in the image are not as well understood, including the Arc, just to the left of Sgr A, and numerous filamentary threads.

For stars like our Sun, the center condenses into a white dwarf while the outer atmosphere is expelled into space to appear as a planetary nebula.  The expelled outer atmosphere of planetary nebula NGC 1514 appears to be a jumble of bubbles -- when seen in visible light.  But the view from the James Webb Space Telescope in infrared, as featured here, confirms a different story: in this light the nebula shows a distinct hourglass shape, which is interpreted as a cylinder seen along a diagonal.  If you look closely at the center of the nebula, you can also see a bright central star that is part of a binary system.  More observations might better reveal how this nebula is evolving and how the central stars are working together to produce the interesting cylinder and bubbles observed.

No one is sure. What is sure is that the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is one of the best known planetary nebulae on the sky.  Although haunting symmetries are seen in the bright central region, this image was taken to feature its intricately structured outer halo, which spans over three light-years across.  Planetary nebulae have long been appreciated as a final phase in the life of a Sun-like star. Only recently however, have some planetaries been found to have expansive halos, likely formed from material shrugged off during earlier puzzling episodes in the star&#x27;s evolution. While the planetary nebula phase is thought to last for around 10,000 years, astronomers estimate the age of the outer filamentary portions of the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula&#x27;s halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/CatsEyeWide_Niittee_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Halo of the Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/CatsEyeWide_Niittee_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Daniel Adibi&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster are scattered across this nearly 4 degree wide telescopic field of view.

The interplanetary scene was captured in clear but moonlit skies from June Lake, California on April 14. Seen against background of stars toward the constellation Andromeda, the comet was then some 10 light-minutes from our fair planet. Now a target for binoculars and small telescopes in northern hemisphere morning skies this comet SWAN is headed for a perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on May 1. That will bring this visitor from the distant Oort cloud almost as close to the Sun as the orbit of inner planet Mercury.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/C2025_F2SWAN_20250414_DEBartlett.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Comet C/2025 F2 SWAN&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/C2025_F2SWAN_20250414_DEBartlett1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-19&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;In digital brush strokes, Jupiter&#x27;s signature atmospheric bands and vortices were used to form this interplanetary post-impressionist work of art. The creative image from citizen scientist Rick Lundh uses data from the Juno spacecraft&#x27;s JunoCam. To paint on the digital canvas, a JunoCam image with contrasting light and dark tones was chosen for processing and an oil-painting software filter applied. The image data was captured during perijove 10. That was Juno&#x27;s December 16, 2017 close encounter with the solar system&#x27;s ruling gas giant. At the time the spacecraft was cruising about 13,000 kilometers above northern Jovian cloud tops.

Visible to the unaided eye, it appears as a small fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion.  Long exposure, multi-wavelength images like this, however, show the Orion Nebula to be a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark dust.  This digital composite features not only three colors of visible light but four colors of infrared light taken by NASA&#x27;s orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope as well.  The power behind much of the Orion Nebula (M42) is the Trapezium - four of the brightest stars in the nebula.  Many of the filamentary structures visible are actually shock waves - fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas.  The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located about 1500 light years away in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/M42_SpitzerCzernetz_2000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Orion Nebula in Visible and Infrared&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/M42_SpitzerCzernetz_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Is this one galaxy or two? Although it looks like one, the answer is two. One path to this happening is when a small galaxy collides with a larger galaxy and ends up in the center. But in the featured image, something more rare is going on. Here, the central light-colored elliptical galaxy is much closer than the blue and red-colored spiral galaxy that surrounds it. This can happen when near and far galaxies are exactly aligned, causing the gravity of the near galaxy to pull the light from the far galaxy around it in an effect called gravitational lensing. The featured galaxy double was taken by the Webb Space Telescope and shows a complete Einstein ring, with great detail visible for both galaxies.  Galaxy lenses like this can reveal new information about the mass distribution of the foreground lens and the light distribution of the background source.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/GalaxiesLens_Webb_1146.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Galaxy Lenses Galaxy from Webb&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/GalaxiesLens_Webb_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nRich Addis\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What&#x27;s different about this Moon? It&#x27;s the terminators. In the featured image, you can&#x27;t directly see any terminator -- the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night. That&#x27;s because the featured image is a digital composite of many near-terminator lunar strips over a full Moon.  Terminator regions show the longest and most prominent shadows -- shadows which, by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear three-dimensional. The overlay images were taken over two weeks in early April.  Many of the Moon&#x27;s craters stand out because of the shadows they all cast to the right. The image shows in graphic detail that the darker regions known as maria are not just darker than the rest of the Moon -- they are also flatter.

First, slanting down from the upper left and far in the distance is the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.  More modestly, slanting down from the upper right and high in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is a bright meteor. The dim band of light across the central diagonal is zodiacal light: sunlight reflected from dust in the inner Solar System. The green glow on the far right is aurora high in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  The bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom is just a light that was held by the scene-planning astrophotographer.

Seen at the center of the cosmic cloud, the star is a mere 3 to 4 million years old. In another three to four million years the massive star will end its life in a supernova explosion. Spanning around 4 light-years, the nebula itself has a bipolar symmetry. That makes it similar in appearance to more common and familiar planetary nebulae - the gaseous shrouds surrounding dying sun-like stars. Also like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have an extensive, faint halo, revealed in this deep image of the region. Expanding into the surrounding interstellar medium, the material in the halo is likely from an earlier active phase of the O star. This gorgeous telescopic view is a composite of extensive narrow-band image data, highlighting glowing atomic hydrogen gas in red and oxygen in greenish hues, with broad-band data for the surrounding starfield.

On April 20, this sharp close-up of the asteroid was captured at a distance of about 1100 kilometers by the Lucy spacecraft&#x27;s long range camera during its second asteroid encounter. Named after American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, discoverer of the Lucy hominid fossil, the elongated asteroid was likely formed about 150 million years ago from a gentle collision of two smaller bodies creating its characteristic contact binary shape. Launched in October of 2021, the Lucy spacecraft will continue its travels through the main asteroid belt in 2025, but is on its way to explore Jupiter&#x27;s swarm of Trojan asteroids.

Some 170,000 light-years across and over 200 million light-years away toward the constellation Virgo, the magnificent spiral galaxy is seen face-on in Hubble&#x27;s view. Within the galactic disk, loose streamers of star forming regions lie along the galaxy&#x27;s flocculent spiral arms. But the most striking feature of NGC 5335 is its prominent central bar. Seen in about 30 percent of galaxies, including our Milky Way, bar structures are understood to channel material inward toward the galactic center, fueling star formation. Of course, distant background galaxies are easy to spot, scattered around the sharp Hubble image. Launched in 1990, Hubble is now celebrating its 35th year exploring the cosmos from orbit around planet Earth.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/NGC5335heic2505_2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 5335&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/NGC5335heic2505_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What is creating the strange texture of IC 418?  Dubbed the Spirograph Nebula for its resemblance to drawings from a cyclical drawing tool, planetary nebula IC 418 shows patterns that are not well understood. Perhaps they are related to chaotic winds from the variable central star, which changes brightness unpredictably in just a few hours.  By contrast, evidence indicates that only a few million years ago, IC 418 was probably a well-understood star similar to our Sun.  Only a few thousand years ago, IC 418 was probably a common red giant star.  Since running out of nuclear fuel, though, the outer envelope has begun expanding outward leaving a hot remnant core destined to become a white-dwarf star, visible in the image center. The light from the central core excites surrounding atoms in the nebula causing them to glow. IC 418 lies about 2000 light-years away and spans 0.3 light-years across.  This false-color image taken from the Hubble Space Telescope reveals the unusual details.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Spirograph_Hubble_2119.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;IC 418: The Spirograph Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Spirograph_Hubble_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nFrancis Bozon &amp; Cecil Navick\n(AstroA.

The visible interstellar gas and dust, shown in colors of the Hubble palette, is part of the star cluster&#x27;s natal molecular cloud, itself cataloged as Gum 37. Dense streamers of material within the nebula, eroded by stellar winds and radiation, clearly trail away from the energetic young stars.  They are likely sites of ongoing star formation with shapes reminiscent of the Tadpoles of IC 410 -- better known to northern skygazers.  In the coming tens to hundreds of millions of years, gas and stars in the cluster will be dispersed though, by gravitational tides and by violent supernova explosions that end the short lives of the massive cluster stars.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Gum37Hoo_Bozon_4863.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Gum 37 and the Southern Tadpoles&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Gum37Hoo_Bozon_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nNatan Fontes\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Where are Saturn&#x27;s ears? Galileo is credited, in 1610, as the first person to see Saturn&#x27;s rings. Testing out Lipperhey&#x27;s recently co-invented telescope, Galileo did not know what they were and so called them \&quot;ears\&quot;.  The mystery deepened in 1612, when Saturn&#x27;s ears mysteriously disappeared. Today we know exactly what happened: from the perspective of the Earth, Saturn&#x27;s rings had become too thin to see.  The same drama plays out every 15 years because Saturn, like Earth, undergoes tilt-driven seasons. This means that as Saturn goes around the Sun, its equator and rings can tilt noticeably toward the Sun and inner Solar System, making them easily visible, but from other orbital locations will appear almost not at all.  The featured picture from Brasilia, Brazil shows a modern version of this sequence: the top ring-dominated image was taken in 2020, while the bottom ring-obscure image taken earlier in 2025.

The star forming region also appears to contain a large population of infant stars. A mere 3 to 5 million years old and not yet burning hydrogen in their cores, the infant stars are strewn about the embedded star cluster.

If any object made of regular matter spins too fast -- it breaks apart. But a black hole might not be able to break apart -- and its maximum spin rate is really unknown. Theorists usually model rapidly rotating black holes with the Kerr solution to Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity, which predicts several amazing and unusual things.  Perhaps its most easily testable prediction, though, is that matter entering a maximally rotating black hole should be last seen orbiting at near the speed of light, as seen from far away. This prediction was tested by NASA&#x27;s NuSTAR and ESA&#x27;s XMM satellites by observing the supermassive black hole at the center of spiral galaxy NGC 1365. The near light-speed limit was confirmed by measuring the heating and spectral line broadening of nuclear emissions at the inner edge of the surrounding accretion disk. Pictured here is an artist&#x27;s illustration depicting an accretion disk of normal matter swirling around a black hole, with a jet emanating from the top. Since matter randomly falling into the black hole should not spin up a black hole this much, the NuSTAR and XMM measurements also validate the existence of the  surrounding accretion disk.

Objects in the sky sometimes appear reflected as lines across water \u2014 but why? If the water\u2019s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would appear similarly -- as spots. But if the water is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line. The same effect is frequently seen for the Sun just before sunset and just after sunrise. Pictured about 10 days ago in Ibiza, Spain, images of the rising Moon, Venus (top), and Saturn (right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the Mediterranean Sea.

Light rays from accretion disks around a pair of orbiting supermassive black holes make their way through the warped space-time produced by extreme gravity in this detailed computer visualization.  The simulated accretion disks have been given different false color schemes, red for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole, and blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass black hole.  For these masses, though, both accretion disks would actually emit most of their light in the ultraviolet.  The video allows us to see both sides of each black hole at the same time.  Red and blue light originating from both black holes can be seen in the innermost ring of light, called the photon sphere, near their event horizons.  In the past decade, gravitational waves from black hole collisions have actually been detected, although the coalescence of supermassive black holes remains undiscovered.

The gravity from each galaxy dramatically affects the other during each hundred-million-year pass.  Last go-round, M82&#x27;s gravity likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in the richness of M81&#x27;s spiral arms.

In fact, the Crab Nebula is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the death explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second. You can see the expansion by comparing these sharp images from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The Crab&#x27;s dynamic, fragmented filaments were captured in visible light by Hubble in 2005 and Webb in infrared light in 2023. This cosmic crustacean lies about 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Crab_Webb_998.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;M1: The Incredible Expanding Crab&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Crab_Webb_998.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How do black holes create X-rays? Answering this long-standing question was significantly advanced recently with data taken by NASA\u2019s IXPE satellite. X-rays cannot exit a black hole, but they can be created in the energetic environment nearby, in particular by a jet of particles moving outward. By observing X-ray light arriving from near the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy BL Lac, called a blazar, it was discovered that these X-rays lacked significant polarization, which is expected when created more by energetic electrons than protons. In the featured artistic illustration, a powerful jet is depicted emanating from an orange-colored accretion disk circling the black hole. Understanding highly energetic processes across the universe helps humanity to understand similar processes that occur on or near our Earth.

The cosmic cloud spans about 3 light-years, nestled securely within the boundaries of the southern constellation of the Furnace (Fornax). Recognized as a planetary nebula, egg-shaped NGC 1360 doesn&#x27;t represent a beginning, though. Instead, it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the evolution of an aging star. In fact, visible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360 is known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two evolved white dwarf stars, less massive but much hotter than the Sun.  Their intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has stripped away electrons from the atoms in their mutually surrounding gaseous shroud. The blue-green hue inside of NGC 1360 seen here is the strong emission produced as electrons recombine with doubly ionized oxygen atoms.

The dramatic, low-angle, near-twilight scene follows rugged mountains formally known as Norgay Montes from foreground left, and Hillary Montes along the horizon, giving way to smooth Sputnik Planum at right. Layers of Pluto&#x27;s tenuous atmosphere are also revealed in the backlit view. With a strangely familiar appearance, the frigid terrain likely includes ices of nitrogen and carbon monoxide with water-ice mountains rising up to 3,500 meters (11,000 feet).

Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) can be seen as a bright spot about once a month from many locations.  The ISS is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth&#x27;s shadow, it will drop out of sight. The only occasion when the ISS is visible during the day is when it passes right in front of the Sun. Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the ISS&#x27;s silhouette onto the background Sun. The featured picture did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from Sant Feliu de Buixalleu, Spain with perfect timing.

Constructed from Hubble Space Telescope image data, the stunning scene spans about half a light-year across Herbig-Haro 24 (HH 24), some 1,300 light-years or 400 parsecs away in the stellar nurseries of the Orion B molecular cloud complex. Hidden from direct view, HH 24&#x27;s central protostar is surrounded by cold dust and gas flattened into a rotating accretion disk. As material from the disk falls toward the young stellar object, it heats up. Opposing jets are blasted out along the system&#x27;s rotation axis. Cutting through the region&#x27;s interstellar matter, the narrow, energetic jets produce a series of glowing shock fronts along their path.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/hs-2015-42-a-fullHH24.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Herbig-Haro 24&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/hs-2015-42-a-largeHH241024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Franz Hofmann&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Grand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the attention, flaunting young, bright, blue star clusters and pinkish star forming regions along graceful, symmetric spiral arms. But small galaxies form stars too, like irregular dwarf galaxy Sextans A. Its young star clusters and star forming regions are gathered into a gumdrop-shaped region a mere 5,000 light-years across. Seen toward the navigational constellation Sextans, the small galaxy lies some 4.5 million light-years distant. That puts it near the outskirts of the local group of galaxies, that includes the large, massive spirals Andromeda and our own Milky Way. Brighter Milky Way foreground stars appear spiky and yellowish in this colorful telescopic view of Sextans A.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/sexa_gemsbock_cdk_pub.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Irregular Dwarf Galaxy Sextans A&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/sexa_gemsbock_cdk_pub1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Tunc Tezel&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-30&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This composite of images spaced a weather-permitting 5 to 9 days apart, from 2024 September 19 (top right) through 2025 May 18 (bottom left), faithfully traces ruddy-colored Mars as it makes a clockwise loop through the constellations Gemini and Cancer in planet Earth&#x27;s night sky. You can connect the dots and dates with your cursor over the image, but be sure to check out this animation of the Red Planet&#x27;s 2024/25 retrograde motion. Of course Mars didn&#x27;t actually reverse the direction of its orbit. Instead, the apparent backwards motion with respect to the background stars is a reflection of the orbital motion of Earth itself. Retrograde motion can be seen each time Earth overtakes and laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the Earth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit.  In this case Mars&#x27; apparent eastward motion began to reverse around December 8, when it seemed to linger near open star cluster M44 in Cancer. After wandering back to the west, under Gemini&#x27;s bright stars Castor and Pollux, Mars returned to pose near M44 by early May. At its brightest near opposition on 2025 January 16, Mars was a mere 96 million kilometers away.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Ma2024-5.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mars in the Loop&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Ma2024-5_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Marcella Giulia Pace&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-31&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On May 7, the Sun setting behind a church bell tower was captured in this filtered and manipulated digital skyscape from Ragusa, Sicily, planet Earth. In this version of the image the colors look bizarre. Still, an intriguing optical illusion known as an afterimage can help you experience the same scene with a more natural looking appearance. To try it, find the sunspots of active region AR4079 grouped near the bottom of the blue solar disk. Relax and stare at the dark sunspot group for about 30 seconds, then close your eyes or shift your gaze to a plain white surface. In a moment an afterimage of the sunset should faintly appear.

Although details remain uncertain, it surely has to do with an ongoing battle with its smaller galactic neighbor. The featured galaxy is labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its collisional partner is known as Arp 273. The overall shape of UGC 1810 -- in particular its blue outer ring -- is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions. This ring&#x27;s blue color is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.  The inner galaxy appears older, redder, and threaded with cool filamentary dust.  A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to UGC 1810, while several galaxies are visible well in the background.  Arp 273 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of Andromeda.  Quite likely, UGC 1810 will devour its galactic sidekick over the next billion years and settle into a classic spiral form.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/Arp273Main_HubblePestana_3079.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;UGC 1810: Wildly Interacting Galaxy from Hubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/Arp273Main_HubblePestana_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nAbdullah Alharbi\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star.  About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a supernova, leaving the Veil Nebula.  At the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history.  Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).  The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  The featured picture was taken in Kuwait in mid-2024 and features light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue.  In deep images of the complete Veil Nebula like this, even studious readers might not be able to identify the iconic filaments.

Airglow.  Now, air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see. A disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- may cause noticeable rippling in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. These gravity waves are oscillations in air analogous to those created when a rock is thrown in calm water.  The long-duration exposure nearly along the vertical walls of airglow likely made the undulating structure particularly visible.  OK, but where do the colors originate?  The deep red glow likely originates from OH molecules about 87 kilometers high, excited by ultraviolet light from the Sun. The orange and green airglow is likely caused by sodium and oxygen atoms slightly higher up.  The featured image was captured during a climb up Mount Pico in the Azores of Portugal.  Ground lights originate from the island of Faial in the Atlantic Ocean.  A spectacular sky is visible through this banded airglow, with the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy running up the image center, and M31, the Andromeda Galaxy, visible near the top left.

No -- the night sky changes every night in many ways. To better explore how the night sky changes, the USA&#x27;s NSF and DOE commissioned the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Cerro Pach\u00f3n, Chile. In final testing before routine operations, Rubin will begin to explore these nightly changes -- slight differences that can tell us much about our amazing universe and its surprising zoo of objects. With a mirror over 8 meters across, Rubin will continually reimage the entire visible sky every few nights to discover new supernovas, potentially dangerous asteroids, faint comets, and variable stars -- as well as mapping out the visible universe&#x27;s large-scale structure.  Pictured, the distant central band of our Milky Way Galaxy appears to flow out from the newly operational observatory. Taken last month, the featured picture is a composite of 21 images across the night sky, capturing airglow on the horizon and the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy on the lower left.

A navigational aid for sailors on the Adriatic Sea, the historic lighthouse was constructed in the early 19th century. But Polaris, an even older aid to navigation, shines in the sky above. Alpha star of the constellation Ursa Minor, Polaris is also known as the North Star. In this scene Polaris forms the shortest bright arc near the North Celestial Pole, the extension of Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation into space. Of course, the North Celestial Pole lies exactly at the center of all the concentric star trails.

With an estimated surface temperature of about 250,000 degrees C, the central star of the planetary nebula is transforming into a white dwarf star, becoming exceptionally hot, and shining brightly in ultraviolet light. The central star is hidden from direct view by a torus of dust, but its energetic ultraviolet light ionizes atoms in the nebula. In this sharp, telescopic view composed with narrowband image data, the ionized hydrogen and doubly ionized oxygen atoms are shown in their characteristic red and blue-green hues to reveal a stunning complex of knots and filaments within the nebula&#x27;s wing-like bipolar outflows. NGC 6302 lies about 4,000 light-years away in the arachnologically correct constellation of the Scorpion (Scorpius).&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC-6302-LRGB-Ha-OIII.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 6302: The Butterfly Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC-6302-LRGB-Ha-OIII_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-07&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On the Mars rover&#x27;s mission Sol 46 or Earth date April 6, 2021, Perseverance held out a robotic arm to take its first selfie on Mars. The WATSON camera at the end of the arm was designed to take close-ups of Martian rocks and surface details though, and not a quick snap shot of friends and smiling faces. In the end, teamwork and weeks of planning on Mars time was required to program a complex series of exposures and camera motions to include Perseverance and its surroundings. The resulting 62 frames were composed into a detailed mosaic, one of the most complicated Mars rover selfies ever taken. In this version of the selfie, the rover&#x27;s Mastcam-Z and SuperCam instruments are looking toward WATSON and the end of the rover&#x27;s outstretched arm. About 4 meters (13 feet) from Perseverance is a robotic companion, the Mars Ingenuity helicopter. Perseverance has now spent over 1,500 sols exploring the surface of the Red Planet.

Nearly 40,000 light-years across, the big, beautiful spiral galaxy is located just 20 million light-years away in the constellation of Leo Minor. This multi-color Hubble Space Telescope close-up of NGC 3344 includes remarkable details from near infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths. The frame extends some 15,000 light-years across the spiral&#x27;s central regions. From the core outward, the galaxy&#x27;s colors change from the yellowish light of old stars in the center to young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions along the loose, fragmented spiral arms. Of course, the bright stars with a spiky appearance are in front of NGC 3344 and lie well within our own Milky Way.

Likely not \u2014 because this is a discovery image.  Massive stars forge heavy elements in their cores and, after a few million years, end their lives in powerful supernova explosions. These remnants cool relatively quickly and fade, making them difficult to detect.  To uncover such faint, previously unknown supernova remnants, a dedicated group of amateur astrophotographers searched through sky surveys for possible supernova remnant candidates.  The result: the first-ever image of supernova remnant G115.5+9.1 \u2014 named Scylla by its discoverers\u2014glowing faintly in the constellation of the mythological King of Aethiopia: Cepheus.  Emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red, and faint emission from oxygen is shown in hues of blue.  Surprisingly, another discovery lurked to the upper right: a faint, previously unknown planetary nebula candidate. In keeping with mythological tradition, it was named Charybdis (Sai 2) \u2014 a nod to the ancient Greek expression \&quot;caught between Scylla and Charybdis\&quot; from Homer\u2019s Odyssey.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_2094.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Between Scylla and Charybdis: A Double Cosmic Discovery&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Do oceans under the ice of Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus contain life?  A reason to think so involves  long features -- some dubbed tiger stripes -- that are known to be spewing ice from the moon&#x27;s icy interior into space. These surface cracks create clouds of fine ice particles over the moon&#x27;s South Pole and create  Saturn&#x27;s mysterious E-ring.  Evidence for this has come from the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.  Pictured here, a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown in true color from a close flyby.  The deep crevasses are partly shadowed.  Why Enceladus is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon Mimas, approximately the same size, appears quite dead. An analysis of ejected ice grains has yielded evidence that complex organic molecules exist inside Enceladus. These large carbon-rich molecules bolster -- but do not prove -- that oceans under Enceladus&#x27; surface could contain life.

It&#x27;s likely that you do, even though some bright stars have names so old they date back to near the beginning of written language. Many world cultures have their own names for the brightest stars, and it is culturally and historically important to remember them.  In the interest of clear global communication, however, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has begun to designate standardized star names.  Featured here in true color are the 25 brightest stars in the night sky, currently as seen by humans, coupled with their IAU-recognized names. Some star names have interesting meanings, including Sirius (\&quot;the scorcher\&quot; in Latin), Vega (\&quot;falling\&quot; in Arabic), and Antares (\&quot;rival to Mars\&quot; in Greek).

When viewed along a narrow path that mostly avoided landfall, the Moon in silhouette created a hybrid solar eclipse. Hybrid eclipses are rare and can be seen as a total eclipse or an annular \&quot;ring of fire\&quot; eclipse depending on the observer&#x27;s position. Viewers of this much anticipated hybrid event were able to witness a total solar eclipse while anchored in the Indian Ocean near the centerline of the eclipse track off the coast of western Australia. This ship-borne image from renowned eclipse chaser Fred Espenak captured the eclipsed Sun&#x27;s magnificent outer atmosphere, or solar corona, streaming into space. The composite of 11 exposures ranging from 1/2000 to 1/2 second, taken during the 62 seconds of totality, records an extended range of brightness to follow alluring details of the corona not quite visible to the eye.

Part of an investigation to understand how galaxies can grow to such enormous sizes, UGC 2885 was also part of An Interesting Voyage and American astronomer Vera Rubin&#x27;s pioneering study of the rotation of spiral galaxies.

For comparison, two images of our common star were taken at sunset, one from Earth and one from Mars. These images were scaled to have the same angular width and are featured here side-by-side. A quick inspection will reveal that the Sun appears slightly smaller from Mars than from Earth. This makes sense since Mars is 50% further from the Sun than Earth. More striking, perhaps, is that the Martian sunset is noticeably bluer near the Sun than the typically orange colors near the setting Sun from Earth. The reason for the blue hues from Mars is not fully understood, but thought to be related to forward scattering properties of Martian dust. The terrestrial sunset was taken in 2012 March from Marseille, France, while the Martian sunset was captured in 2015 by NASA&#x27;s robotic Curiosity rover from Gale crater on Mars.

The red flowery-looking nebula just above the image center may seem a good choice, but that&#x27;s not it.  The famous Rosette Nebula is really located on the lower right, here colored blue and white, and connected to the other nebulas by gold-colored filaments.  Because the featured image of Rosette&#x27;s field is so wide, and because of its deep red exposure, it seems to contain other flowers.  Designated NGC 2237, the center of the Rosette Nebula is populated by the bright blue stars of open cluster NGC 2244, whose winds and energetic light are evacuating the nebula&#x27;s center.  The Rosette Nebula is about 5,000 light years distant and, just by itself, spans about three times the diameter of a full moon. This flowery field can be found toward the constellation of the Unicorn  (Monoceros).

It&#x27;s the International Space Station. Using precise timing, the Earth-orbiting space platform was photographed in front of a partially lit gibbous Moon in 2019. The featured image was taken from Palo Alto, California, USA with an exposure time of only 1/667 of a second. In contrast, the duration of the transit of the ISS across the entire Moon was about half a second.  A close inspection of this unusually crisp ISS silhouette will reveal the outlines of numerous solar panels and trusses.  The bright crater Tycho is visible on the lower left, as well as comparatively rough, light colored terrain known as highlands and relatively smooth, dark colored areas known as maria.  Downloadable  apps can tell you when the International Space Station will be visible from your area.

Relatively bright in planet Earth&#x27;s sky, NGC 3521 is easily visible in small telescopes but often overlooked by amateur imagers in favor of other Leo spiral galaxies, like M66 and M65. It&#x27;s hard to overlook in this colorful cosmic portrait though. Spanning some 50,000 light-years the galaxy sports characteristic patchy, irregular spiral arms laced with dust, pink star forming regions, and clusters of young, blue stars. The deep image also finds NGC 3521 embedded in fainter, gigantic, bubble-like shells. The shells are likely tidal debris, streams of stars torn from satellite galaxies that have undergone mergers with NGC 3521 in the distant past.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC3521-2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 3521: Galaxy in a Bubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC3521-1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Luca Vanzella&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;dmonton, Alberta, Canada, planet Earth lies on the horizon in this stack of panoramic composite images. In a monthly time series arranged vertically top to bottom the ambitious photographic project follows the annual north-south swing of sunrise points, from June solstice to December solstice and back again. It also follows the corresponding, but definitely harder to track, Full Moon rise. Of course, the north-south swing of moonrise runs opposite sunrise along the horizon. But these rising Full Moons also span a wider range on the horizon than the sunrises. That&#x27;s because the well-planned project (as shown in this video) covers the period June 2024 to June 2025, centered on a major lunar standstill. Major lunar standstills represent extremes in the north-south range of moonrise driven by the 18.6 year precession period of the lunar orbit.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/MajorLunarStandstillAPOD.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Major Lunar Standstill 2024-2025&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/MajorLunarStandstillAPOD_1200.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Tunc Tezel&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Sure, that figure-8 shaped curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun in Earth&#x27;s sky at the same time each day over one year is called an analemma. On the left, Earth&#x27;s figure-8 analemma was traced by combining wide-angle digital images recorded during the year from December 2011 through December 2012. But the shape of an analemma depends on the eccentricity of a planet&#x27;s orbit and the tilt of its axis of rotation, so analemma curves can look different for different worlds. Take Mars for example. The Red Planet&#x27;s axial tilt is similar to Earth&#x27;s, but its orbit around the same sun is more eccentric (less circular) than Earth&#x27;s orbit. As seen from the Martian surface, the analemma traced in the right hand panel is shaped more like a tear drop. The Mars rover Opportunity captured the images used over the Martian year corresponding to Earth dates July 2006 to June 2008. Of course, each world&#x27;s solstice dates still lie at the top and bottom of their different analemma curves. The last Mars northern summer solstice was May 29, 2025. Our fair planet&#x27;s 2025 northern summer solstice is at June 21, 2:42 UTC.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/AnalemmaEarthMars.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Two Worlds, Two Analemmas&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/AnalemmaEarthMars1200.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How were these unusual Martian spherules created?  Thousands of unusual gray spherules made of iron and rock and dubbed blueberries were found embedded in and surrounding rocks near the landing site of the robot Opportunity rover on Mars in 2004.  To help investigate their origin, Opportunity found a surface dubbed the Berry Bowl with an indentation that was rich in the Martian orbs.  The Berry Bowl is pictured here, imaged during rover&#x27;s 48th Martian day.  The average size of a Martian blueberry rock is only about 4 millimeters across.  By analyzing a circular patch in the rock surface to the left of the densest patch of spherules, Opportunity obtained data showing that the underlying rock has a much different composition than the hematite rich blueberries.  This information contributes to the growing consensus that these small, strange, gray orbs were slowly deposited from a bath of dirty water.

Images of the star forming region W5 like those in the infrared by NASA&#x27;s Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, later NEOWISE) satellite provide clear clues with indications that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges.  A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars.  The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars.  In the featured scientifically colored infrared image, spectacular pillars left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas provide further visual clues. W5 is also known as Westerhout 5 (W5) and IC 1848.  Together with IC 1805, the nebulas form a complex region of star formation popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulas. The featured image highlights a part of W5 spanning about 2,000 light years that is rich in star forming pillars.  W5 lies about 6,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.

Sort of.  Image data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the European Southern Observatory, and smaller telescopes on planet Earth are combined in this detailed portrait of face-on spiral galaxy Messier 61 (M61) and its bright center. A mere 55 million light-years away in the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies, M61 is also known as NGC 4303.  It&#x27;s considered to be an example of a barred spiral galaxy similar to our own Milky Way.  Like other spiral galaxies, M61 also features sweeping spiral arms, cosmic dust lanes, pinkish star forming regions, and young blue star clusters.  Its core houses an active supermassive black hole surrounded by a bright nuclear spiral -- infalling star-forming gas that itself looks like a separate spiral galaxy.

A First Look image captured at the new NSF\u2013DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the bright nebulae and star clusters featured include famous stops on telescopic tours of the cosmos: Messier 8 and Messier 20. An expansive star-forming region over a hundred light-years across, Messier 8 is also known as the Lagoon Nebula. About 4,000 light-years away the Lagoon Nebula harbors a remarkable cluster of young, massive stars. Their intense radiation and stellar winds energize and agitate this cosmic lagoon&#x27;s turbulent depths. Messier 20&#x27;s popular moniker is the Trifid. Divided into three parts by dark interstellar dust lanes, the Trifid Nebula&#x27;s glowing hydrogen gas creates its dominant red color. But contrasting blue hues in the colorful Trifid are due to dust reflected starlight. The Rubin Observatory visited the Trifid-Lagoon field to acquire all the image data during parts of four nights (May 1-4). At full resolution, Rubin&#x27;s magnificent Sagittarius skyscape is 84,000 pixels wide and 51,500 pixels tall.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SagittariusTrip_Rubin.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rubin&#x27;s First Look: A Sagittarius Skyscape&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SagittariusTrip_Rubin1100.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Timothy Martin&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-26&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;An interstellar expanse of glowing gas and obscuring dust presents a bird-like visage to astronomers from planet Earth, suggesting its popular moniker, the Seagull Nebula. This broadband portrait of the cosmic bird covers a 3.5-degree wide swath across the plane of the Milky Way, in the direction of Sirius, alpha star of the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major). The bright head of the Seagull Nebula is cataloged as IC 2177, a compact, dusty emission and reflection nebula with embedded massive star HD 53367. The larger emission region, encompassing objects with other catalog designations, is Likely part of an extensive shell structure swept up by successive supernova explosions. The notable bluish arc below and right of center is a bow shock from runaway star FN Canis Majoris. Dominated by the reddish glow of atomic hydrogen, this complex of interstellar gas and dust clouds with other stars of the Canis Majoris OB1 association spans over 200 light-years at the Seagull Nebula&#x27;s estimated 3,800 light-year distance.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/IC2177SeagullLRGB-APOD2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Seagull Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/IC2177SeagullLRGB-APOD1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Robert Eder&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Big beautiful barred spiral galaxy Messier 109 is the 109th entry in Charles Messier&#x27;s famous catalog of bright Nebulae and Star Clusters. You can find it just below the Big Dipper&#x27;s bowl in the northern constellation Ursa Major. In fact, bright dipper star Phecda, Gamma Ursa Majoris, produces the glare at the upper right corner of this telescopic frame. M109&#x27;s prominent central bar gives the galaxy the appearance of the Greek letter \&quot;theta\&quot;, \u03b8, a common mathematical symbol representing an angle. M109 spans a very small angle in planet Earth&#x27;s sky though, about 7 arcminutes or 0.12 degrees. But that small angle corresponds to an enormous 120,000 light-year diameter at the galaxy&#x27;s estimated 60 million light-year distance. The brightest member of the now recognized Ursa Major galaxy cluster, M109 (aka NGC 3992) is joined by spiky foreground stars. Three small, fuzzy bluish galaxies also on the scene, identified (top to bottom) as UGC 6969, UGC 6940 and UGC 6923, are possibly satellite galaxies of the larger barred spiral galaxy Messier 109.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/M109_Robert_Eder.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier 109&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/M109_Robert_Eder1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-28&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Tidally locked in synchronous rotation, the Moon always presents its familiar nearside to denizens of planet Earth. From lunar orbit, the Moon&#x27;s farside can become familiar, though. In fact this sharp picture, a mosaic from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&#x27;s wide angle camera, is centered on the lunar farside. Part of a global mosaic of over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009 and February 2011, the highest resolution version shows features at a scale of 100 meters per pixel. Surprisingly, the rough and battered surface of the farside looks very different from the nearside covered with smooth dark lunar maria.  A likely explanation is that the farside crust is thicker, making it harder for molten material from the interior to flow to the surface and form dark, smooth maria.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/farside_lro1600.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Lunar Farside&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/farside_lro800.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Are these trees growing on Mars? No.  Groups of dark brown streaks have been photographed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on melting pinkish sand dunes covered with light frost. The featured image was taken in 2008 April near the North Pole of Mars. At that time, dark sand on the interior of Martian sand dunes became more and more visible as the spring Sun melted the lighter carbon dioxide ice.  When occurring near the top of a dune, dark sand may cascade down the dune leaving dark surface streaks -- streaks that might appear at first to be trees standing in front of the lighter regions but cast no shadows. Objects about 25 centimeters across are resolved on this image spanning about one kilometer. Close ups of some parts of this image show billowing plumes indicating that the sand slides were occurring even while the image was being taken.

What appears to be a giant cosmic umbrella is now known to be a tidal stream of stars stripped from a small satellite galaxy. The main galaxy, spiral galaxy NGC 4651, is about the size of our Milky Way, while its stellar parasol appears to extend some 100 thousand light-years above this galaxy&#x27;s bright disk. A small galaxy was likely torn apart by repeated encounters as it swept back and forth on eccentric orbits through NGC 4651. The remaining stars will surely fall back and become part of a combined larger galaxy over the next few million years. The featured deep image was captured in long exposures from Saudi Arabia.

The meteors were expected as sub-sand grains long left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle annually create the Perseids Meteor Shower.  The aurorae were unexpected, however, as electrons, protons, and heavier ions raced out from a large Coronal Mass Ejection that had occurred just days before on the Sun.  In the foreground is Hahn&#x27;s Peak, an extinct volcano in Colorado, USA.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/perseidaurora_westlake_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Perseid Aurora&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/perseidaurora_westlake.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2001-02-12&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Today, at about 3 pm EST, the first human-made spacecraft is scheduled to touchdown on an asteroid.  At an impact speed of 8 kilometers per hour, it is most probable that the robot spacecraft NEAR-Shoemaker will not survive its planned collision with 433 Eros.  A primary reason for the descent, diagrammed above, will be to take images during the four hours on the way down.  If all goes well, some of those pictures will show surface features as small as 10 centimeters across.  Scientists hope to learn more about this unusual Manhattan-sized rock that is, quite possibly, older than the Earth.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/orbit_near_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Approaching Asteroid Eros&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/orbit_near.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;1996-10-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why is Io green at night? In this just-released nighttime picture\r of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io,\r the red spots clearly show Io&#x27;s\r current volcanically active regions.\r But what is causing the global green sheen? This telling picture\r was taken by the automated Galileo spacecraft currently orbiting Jupiter\r while Io was in Jupiter&#x27;s shadow. One hypothesis is that the green\r glow is caused by a different type of aurora\r resulting from high-energy particles interacting with Io&#x27;s volcanic plumes.\r&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/iohotspots_gal_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Io&#x27;s Active Volcanoes\r\nCredit:&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/iohotspots_gal.gif&quot;}]

It&#x27;s not even close.  The odd looking \&quot;creature\&quot; or \&quot;hand\&quot; extending down from the top of the above photo is a gas cloud known as a cometary globule.  This globule, however, has ruptured.  Cometary globules are typically characterized by dusty heads and elongated tails.  These features cause cometary globules to have visual similarities to comets, but in reality they are very much different.  Globules are frequently the birthplaces of stars, and many show very young stars in their heads. The reason for the rupture in the head of this object is not completely known.  The galaxy to the near the bottom of the image is huge, very far in the distance, and only placed near CG4 by chance superposition.

At a distance of 180 light-years it is the closest known neutron star. More massive than the Sun but only 20 kilometers across, this tiny stellar juggernaut plows through the hydrogen gas and dust clouds of interstellar space at about 200 kilometers per second. The surface of the neutron star is fantastically hot, around 700,000 degrees Celsius, making it detectable with orbiting x-ray telescopes. But optical astronomers were recently surprised to discover that RX J1856.5-3754 is also surrounded by a cone-shaped nebula. Indicated in this deep image from the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s Kueyen telescope, the nebula glows in the red light of ionized hydrogen atoms recombining with electrons. Its cone shape is analogous to the bow wave of a ship plowing through water. A faint blue dot near the tip of the cone is the neutron star itself. The nebula appears to have formed very near the surface of the neutron star and astronomers are trying to determine if the observed densities and temperatures can indeed explain the nebula&#x27;s appearance.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0010/neutronnebula_eso_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Nebula And The Neutron Star&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0010/neutronnebula_eso.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-04-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;While cruising around Saturn, be on the lookout for picturesque juxtapositions of moons, rings, and shadows. One quite picturesque arrangement occurred in 2005 and was captured by the then Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft. In the featured image, moons Tethys and Mimas are visible on either side of Saturn&#x27;s thin rings, which are seen nearly edge-on.  Across the top of Saturn are dark shadows of the wide rings, exhibiting their impressive complexity. The violet-light image brings up the texture of the backdrop: Saturn&#x27;s clouds. Cassini orbited Saturn from 2004 until September of last year, when the robotic spacecraft was directed to dive into Saturn to keep it from contaminating any moons.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1804/SaturnRingsMoons_Cassini_967.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Moons, Rings, Shadows, Clouds: Saturn (Cassini)&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1804/SaturnRingsMoons_Cassini_967.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nTalha Zia\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-05-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why does the right part of this image of the Moon stand out?  Shadows. The terminator line -- the line between light and dark -- occurs in the featured image so that just over half the Moon&#x27;s face is illuminated by sunlight. The lunar surface appears different nearer the terminator because there the Sun is nearer the horizon and therefore causes shadows to become increasingly long.  These shadows make it easier for us to discern structure, giving us depth cues so that the two-dimensional image, when dominated by shadows, appears almost three-dimensional. Therefore, as the Moon fades from light to dark, shadows not only tell us the high from the low, but become noticeable for increasingly shorter structures. For example, many craters appear near the terminator because their height makes them easier to discern there.  The image was taken two weeks ago when the lunar phase was waning gibbous. The next full moon, a Moon without shadows, will occur one week from today.

The above image shows, however, that even during off days the Sun&#x27;s surface is a busy place.  Shown in ultraviolet light, the relatively cool dark regions have temperatures of thousands of degrees Celsius.  Large sunspot group AR 9169 is visible as the bright area near the horizon.  The bright glowing gas flowing around the sunspots has a temperature of over one million degrees Celsius.  The reason for the high temperatures is unknown but thought to be related to the rapidly changing magnetic field loops that channel solar plasma.  Sunspot group AR 9169 moved across the Sun during 2000 September and decayed in a few weeks.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0205/sun2_trace_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Sunspot Loops in Ultraviolet&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0205/sun2_trace.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nESA,\nGaia,\nDPAC\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-04-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This grand allsky view of our Milky Way and nearby galaxies is not a photograph. It&#x27;s a map based on individual measurements for nearly 1.7 billion stars. The astronomically rich data set used to create it, the sky-scanning Gaia satellite&#x27;s second data release, includes remarkably precise determinations of position, brightness, colour, and parallax distance for 1.3 billion stars. Of course, that&#x27;s about 1 percent of the total number of stars in the Milky Way. The flat plane of our galaxy still dominates the view. Home to most Milky Way stars it stretches across the center of Gaia&#x27;s stellar data map. Voids and rifts along the galactic plane correspond to starlight-obscuring interstellar dust clouds. At lower right are stars of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, neighboring galaxies that lie just beyond the Milky Way.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1804/Gaia_s_sky_in_colour_g.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Gaia&#x27;s Milky Way&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1804/Gaia_s_sky_in_colour_g1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2001-10-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Bright gas and dark dust permeate the space between stars in a nebula known as NGC 6559.  The gas, primarily hydrogen, is responsible for the diffuse red glow of the emission nebula.  As energetic light from neighboring stars ionizes interstellar hydrogen, protons and electrons recombine to emit light of very specific colors, including the red hue observed.  Small dust particles reflect blue starlight efficiently and so creates the blue reflection nebulosity seen near two of the bright stars.  Dust also absorbs visible light, causing the dark clouds and filaments visible.  NGC 6559 lies about 5000 light-years away toward the constellation of Sagittarius.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0110/ngc6559_gendler_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Emission and Reflection in NGC 6559&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0110/ngc6559_gendler.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-07-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why does this comet&#x27;s nucleus have two components? The surprising discovery that Comet 67P/Churyumov\ufffdGerasimenko has a double nucleus came late last week as ESA&#x27;s robotic interplanetary spacecraft Rosetta continued its approach toward the ancient comet&#x27;s core. Speculative ideas on how the double core was created include, currently, that Comet Churyumov\ufffdGerasimenko is actually the result of the merger of two comets, that the comet is a loose pile of rubble pulled apart by tidal forces, that ice evaporation on the comet has been asymmetric, or that the comet has undergone some sort of explosive event. Pictured above, the comet&#x27;s unusual 5-km sized comet nucleus is seen rotating over the course of a few hours, with each frame taken 20-minutes apart. Better images -- and hopefully more refined theories -- are expected as Rosetta is on track to enter orbit around Comet Churyumov\ufffdGerasimenko&#x27;s nucleus early next month, and by the end of the year, if possible, land a probe on it.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1407/cometCGrotating_rosetta.gif&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Spacecraft Rosetta Shows Comet has Two Components&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1407/cometCGrotating_rosetta.gif&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-04-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Asteroids can have rings. In a surprising discovery announced two weeks ago, the distant asteroid 10199 Chariklo was found to have at least two orbiting rings. Chariklo&#x27;s diameter of about 250 kilometers makes it the largest of the measured centaur asteroids, but now the smallest known object to have rings. The centaur-class minor planet orbits the Sun between Saturn and Uranus. The above video gives an artist&#x27;s illustration of how the rings were discovered. As Chariklo passed in 2013 in front of a faint star, unexpected but symmetric dips in the brightness of the star revealed the rings. Planetary astronomers are now running computer simulations designed to investigate how Chariklo&#x27;s unexpected ring system might have formed, how it survives, and given the asteroid&#x27;s low mass and close passes of other small asteroids and the planet Uranus, how long it may last.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Two Rings for Asteroid Chariklo&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/90101198?title&#x3D;0&amp;byline&#x3D;0&amp;portrait&#x3D;0&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMichael Richmann\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;1998-08-19&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;M13 is one of the most prominent and best known globular clusters.

The expanding blue and orange filamentary plumes are from first and second stage separation and the first stage boostback burn, still in sunlight at extreme altitudes.

Emerging from the cloud bank below the Pleiades, the narrow sunlit lunar crescent is overexposed. Still, the Moon&#x27;s dim night side is impressively clear, illuminated by earthshine. Bright, innermost planet Mercury lies near the bottom of the field.

Crowd pleasers when imaged with even modest telescopes, they can be introduced individually as NGC 3628 (left), M66 (bottom right), and M65 (top). All three are large spiral galaxies but they tend to look dissimilar because their galactic disks are tilted at different angles to our line of sight. NGC 3628 is seen edge-on, with obscuring dust lanes cutting across the plane of the galaxy, while the disks of M66 and M65 are both inclined enough to show off their spiral structure.  Gravitational interactions between galaxies in the group have also left telltale signs, including the warped and inflated disk of NGC 3628 and the drawn out spiral arms of M66. This gorgeous view of the region spans about one degree (two full moons) on the sky.

Thirty years ago, in 1987, the brightest supernova in recent history was seen in the Large Magellanic Cloud. At the center of the featured picture is an object central to the remains of the violent stellar explosion. Surrounding the center are curious outer rings appearing as a flattened figure 8.  Although large telescopes including the Hubble Space Telescope monitor the curious rings every few years, their origin remains a mystery.  Pictured here is a Hubble image of the SN1987A remnant taken in 2011. Speculation into the cause of the rings includes beamed jets emanating from an otherwise hidden neutron star left over from the supernova, and the interaction of the wind from the progenitor star with gas released before the explosion.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1703/sn1987a_hubble_850.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Mysterious Rings of Supernova 1987A&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1703/sn1987a_hubble_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nOlivier Staiger\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2002-06-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A lunar eclipse can be viewed in a leisurely fashion. Visible to anyone on the night side of planet Earth (weather permitting), totality often lasts an hour or so as the moon glides through the Earth&#x27;s shadow. But a solar eclipse is more fleeting. Totality can last a few minutes only for those fortunate enough to stand in the path of the Moon&#x27;s shadow as it races across the Earth&#x27;s surface. For the April 29, 1995 annular solar eclipse, photographer Olivier Staiger was standing in Macara, Ecuador under partially cloudy skies. Just before the maximum annular eclipse phase he recorded this dramatic moment as a bird flew near the sun. The next solar eclipse, on June 10, will also be an annular one. Partial phases will be visible from eastern Asia, the Pacific Ocean and much of North America. Very accurate predictions of eclipses have long been possible.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/eclipsebird_staiger.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Fleeting Eclipse&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/eclipsebird_staiger.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2007-08-01&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why does one half of Dione have more craters than the other? Start with the fact that Saturn&#x27;s moon Dione always has one side that faces Saturn, and always has one side that faces away.  This is similar to Earth&#x27;s Moon. This tidal locking means that one side of Dione always leads as the moon progresses in its orbit, while the other side always trails.  Dione should therefore have undergone a significant amount of impacts on its leading half. But the current leading half of Dione is less cratered than the trailing half!  A possible explanation is that some impacts were so large they spun Dione, sometimes changing the part that suffered the highest impact rate before the moon&#x27;s spin again became locked.  Pictured above, it is the top part of Dione that appears significantly more cratered than the bottom half.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0707/dione3_cassini_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Unusual Cratering on Saturn&#x27;s Dione&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0707/dione3_cassini.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nBrent Price\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2000-09-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Last month, skywatchers were treated to an unexpected coincidence: bright aurorae occurred during the Perseid Meteor Shower.  The above picture was taken August 12 and captures eerie looking aurorae and a faint Perseid meteor above Cross Lake in Wisconsin, USA.  The near future holds promise for both more aurorae and a better meteor shower.  Aurorae are becoming increasingly common as their trigger -- our Sun -- nears its period of highest activity during its eleven-year magnetic cycle.  Coming up in mid-November is the quirky Leonids Meteor Shower.  Although one of the better studied meteor showers, the Leonids have surprised astronomers many times and so many an optimistic skywatcher promises to be outside this year hoping for a memorable show.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/auroraperseid_price_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Aurora Persei&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/auroraperseid_price.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Dan Bartlett&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2020-06-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Comet PanSTARRs, C/2017 T2, shared this stunning telescopic field of view with galaxies M81 and M82 on May 22/23. Of course, the galaxies were some 12 million light-years distant and the comet about 14 light-minutes away, seen in planet Earth&#x27;s sky toward the Big Dipper. A new visitor from the Oort Cloud, this Comet PanSTARRs was discovered in 2017 by the PanSTARRs survey telescope when the comet was over 1 light-hour from the Sun, almost as distant as the orbit of Saturn. With a beautiful coma and dust tail, this comet has been a solid northern hemisphere performer for telescope wielding comet watchers this May, following its closest approach to the Sun on May 4. In this deep image from dark California skies the outbound comet even seems to develop a short anti-tail as it leaves the inner Solar System.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2006/C2017T2_M81M82_May22_23_2020_DEBartlett.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Comet PanSTARRs and the Galaxies&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2006/C2017T2_M81M82_May22_23_2020_DEBartlett1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2004-11-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Where do gamma ray bursts occur?  To help find out, NASA launched the Swift satellite on Saturday, as pictured above.  What Swift is designed to do better than any previous satellite is to quickly locate these enigmatic explosions in both sky position and distance.  Once a gamma ray burst (GRB) is located, Swift itself will rotate to face it head-on and determine its distance directly.  Swift locations will be immediately beamed down to Earth-based telescopes operating around the world and across the electromagnetic spectrum that are just waiting for a place on the sky to point.  Subsequently collected GRB and afterglow information will help astronomers not only determine the nature of the initial explosions, but also the nature of the expanding shockwaves.  Some Swift-located GRBs could turn out to be the most distant transient events ever detected, holding unique clues to the nature and rate of the very first wave of star formation in the early universe.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0411/launch_swift.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Swift Launches&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0411/launch_swift.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nJudy W.

Of course, quilts have been used historically to represent astronomical concepts.

On that date the well-timed telescopic views detail some remarkable performances, transits and mutual events, by Jupiter&#x27;s Galilean moons. In the top panel, Io is just disappearing into Jupiter&#x27;s shadow at the far right, but the three other large Jovian moons appear against the planet&#x27;s banded disk. Brighter Europa and darker Ganymede are at the far left, also casting their two shadows on the gas giant&#x27;s cloud tops. Callisto is below and right near the planet&#x27;s edge, the three moons in a triple transit across the face of Jupiter. Moving to the middle panel, shadows of Europa and Ganymede are still visible near center but Ganymede has occulted or passed in front of Europa. The bottom panel captures a rare view of Jovian moons in eclipse while transiting Jupiter, Ganymede&#x27;s shadow falling on Europa itself. From planet Earth&#x27;s perspective, similar mutual events, when Galilean moons occult and eclipse each other, can be seen every six years or so when Jupiter is near its own equinox.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2108/j20210815a_cgo.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Triple Transit and Mutual Events&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2108/j20210815a_cgo_crop1200.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nDamia Bouic; \n Right Image Credit:  NASA,\nJPL-Caltech,\nMSSS;\n Digital processing: \nDamia Bouic\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-15&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How different does sunset appear from Mars than from Earth? For comparison, two images of our common star were taken at sunset, one from Earth and one from Mars. These images were scaled to have the same angular width and are featured here side-by-side. A quick inspection will reveal that the Sun appears slightly smaller from Mars than from Earth. This makes sense since Mars is 50% further from the Sun than Earth. More striking, perhaps, is that the Martian sunset is noticeably bluer near the Sun than the typically orange colors near the setting Sun from Earth. The reason for the blue hues from Mars is not fully understood, but thought to be related to forward scattering properties of Martian dust. The terrestrial sunset was taken in 2012 March from Marseille, France, while the Martian sunset was captured in 2015 by NASA&#x27;s robotic Curiosity rover from Gale crater on Mars.

Still, for astronomers NGC 3621 has not been just another pretty face-on spiral galaxy. Some of its brighter stars have been used as standard candles to establish important estimates of extragalactic distances and the scale of the Universe. This beautiful image of NGC 3621, is a composite of space- and ground-based telescope data. It traces the loose spiral arms far from the galaxy&#x27;s brighter central regions for some 100,000 light-years.

The dark site&#x27;s rarefied atmosphere, at about 50 percent sea level pressure, is also extremely dry. That makes it ideal for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) designed to explore the universe at wavelengths over 1,000 times longer than visible light. Near the center of the the panoramic scene, ALMA&#x27;s 7 and 12 meter wide dish antennas are illuminated by a young Moon nestled in the arc of the Milky Way. ALMA&#x27;s antenna configurations are intended to achieve a resolution comparable to space telescopes by operating as an interferometer.

The complex of nebulae lies some 6,000 light-years away, toward the high-flying northern constellation Cygnus and the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy. With foreground dust clouds in silhouette, both reddish hydrogen emission nebulae and dusty blue reflection nebulae fill the 1/2 degree wide field. The view spans nearly 50 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 6914. Ultraviolet radiation from the massive, hot, young stars of the extensive Cygnus OB2 association ionize the region&#x27;s atomic hydrogen gas, producing the characteristic red glow as protons and electrons recombine. Embedded Cygnus OB2 stars also provide the blue starlight strongly reflected by the dusty clouds. Constructed as a two-panel mosaic, the image was processed to bring out both bright and dim colors and detailed structures.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1103/NGC6914_peris.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 6914 Nebulae&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1103/NGC6914_peris_600h.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2003-08-30&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;For billions of years, massive stars in our Milky Way Galaxy have lived spectacular lives.  Collapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces ignite and create heavy elements in their cores. After a few million years, the enriched material is blasted back into interstellar space where star formation begins anew. The expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example of this final phase of the stellar life cycle. Light from the explosion which created this supernova remnant was probably first seen in planet Earth&#x27;s sky just over 300 years ago, although it took that light more than 10,000 years to reach us. In this gorgeous Hubble Space Telescope image of cooling filaments and knots in the Cas A remnant, light from specific elements has been color coded to help astronomers understand the recycling of our galaxy&#x27;s star stuff. For instance, red regions are dominated by emission from sulfur atoms while blue shades correspond to oxygen.

The LMC is an irregular galaxy composed of a bar of older red stars, clouds of younger blue stars, and a bright red star forming region visible near the top of the above image called the Tarantula Nebula.

This distinctive spiral-shaped sunspot caught the attention of National Solar Observatory astronomers and was photographed on February 19, 1982 with the Vacuum Solar Telescope on Kitt Peak. Sunspots appear dark only because they are relatively cool - about 4,000 degrees compared to the 6,000 degrees Celsius of the surrounding solar surface. Associated with surface magnetic fields, their numbers increase and decrease in a regular pattern tracing the Solar Activity cycle. A maximum in sunspot numbers occurs every 11 years with the next maximum expected around the year 2001. This sunspot was actually about 50,000 miles across (Earth&#x27;s diameter is about 8,000 miles) and held its shape for two days.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9902/spiralspot_noao_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Spiral Sunspot&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9902/spiralspot_noao.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2020-12-11&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Many bright nebulae and star clusters in planet Earth&#x27;s sky are associated with the name of astronomer Charles Messier from his famous 18th century catalog. His name is also given to these two large and remarkable craters on the Moon. Standouts in the dark, smooth lunar Sea of Fertility or Mare Fecunditatis, Messier (left) and Messier A have dimensions of 15 by 8 and 16 by 11 kilometers respectively. Their elongated shapes are explained by the extremely shallow-angle trajectory followed by an impactor, moving left to right, that gouged out the craters. The shallow impact also resulted in two bright rays of material extending along the surface to the right, beyond the picture. Intended to be viewed with red/blue glasses (red for the left eye), this striking stereo picture of the crater pair was recently created from high resolution scans of two images (AS11-42-6304, AS11-42-6305) taken during the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2012/MessierCrater3d_vantuyne.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier Craters in Stereo&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2012/MessierCrater3d_vantuyne1024c.jpg&quot;}]

First, the large emission nebula dubbed IC 1805 looks, in whole, like a human heart.  It&#x27;s shape perhaps fitting of the Valentine&#x27;s Day, this heart glows brightly in red light emitted by its most prominent element: hydrogen.  The red glow and the larger shape are all created by a small group of stars near the nebula&#x27;s center.  In the heart of the Heart Nebula are young stars from the open star cluster Melotte 15 that are eroding away several picturesque dust pillars with their energetic light and winds. The open cluster of stars contains a few bright stars nearly 50 times the mass of our Sun, many dim stars only a fraction of the mass of our Sun, and an absent microquasar that was expelled millions of years ago.  The Heart Nebula is located about 7,500 light years away toward the constellation of the mythological Queen of Aethiopia (Cassiopeia).&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1802/HeartBiColor_Erickson_1961.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;In the Heart of the Heart Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1802/HeartBiColor_Erickson_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Astronomical Society of Linz&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2018-05-15&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Four hundred years ago today (May 15, 1618) Johannes Kepler discovered the simple mathematical rule governing the orbits of the solar system&#x27;s planets, now recognized as Kepler&#x27;s Third Law of planetary motion. At that time he was living in this tall house on The Hofgasse, a narrow street near the castle and main square of the city of Linz, Austria, planet Earth. The conclusive identification of this residence (Hofgasse 7) as the location of the discovery of his third law is a recent discovery itself. Erich Meyer of the Astronomical Society of Linz was able to solve the historical mystery, based in part on descriptions of Kepler&#x27;s own observations of lunar eclipses. A key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution, Kepler supported Galileo&#x27;s discoveries and the Copernican system of planets orbiting the Sun instead of the Earth. He showed that planets move in ellipses around the Sun (Kepler&#x27;s First Law), that planets move proportionally faster in their orbits when they are nearer the Sun (Kepler&#x27;s Second Law), and that more distant planets take proportionally longer to orbit the Sun (Kepler&#x27;s Third Law).&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1805/hofgasse7.JPG&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Kepler&#x27;s House in Linz&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1805/hofgasse7_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nRoberto Colombari\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2013-09-18&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever seen the Pleiades star cluster? Even if you have, you probably have never seen it as dusty as this. Perhaps the most famous star cluster on the sky, the bright stars of the Pleiades can be seen without binoculars from even the depths of a light-polluted city.  With a long exposure from a dark location, though, the dust cloud surrounding the Pleiades star cluster becomes very evident. The above exposure took about 20 minutes and covers a sky area several times the size of the full moon.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades lies about 400 light years away toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).  A common legend with a modern twist is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named, leaving only six stars visible to the unaided eye. The actual number of Pleiades stars visible, however, may be more or less than seven, depending on the darkness of the surrounding sky and the clarity of the observer&#x27;s eyesight.

Recent wide field images and analyses now indicate that our home galaxy is actually still in the process of devouring one of its closer satellite neighbors.  This unfortunate neighbor, the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy, is now seen to be part of a larger Sagittarius Tidal Stream, a loose filament of stars, gas, and possibly dark matter that entangles the Milky Way.  An artist&#x27;s depiction of the stream is shown above.  Speculation also holds that the Sagittarius Dwarf was once pulled through the Milky Way disk very close to our Sun&#x27;s current location.  An important resulting realization is that galaxies contain a jumble of clumps and filaments of both dim and dark matter.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0309/sag_dmd_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Sagittarius Dwarf Tidal Stream&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0309/sag_dmd.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Aman Chokshi&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2021-12-11&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;From this vantage point about three quarters of a mile from planet Earth&#x27;s geographic South Pole, the December 4 eclipse of the Sun was seen as a partial eclipse. At maximum the New Moon blocked 90 percent of the solar disk. Of course, crews at the South Pole Telescope (left) and BICEP telescope (right) climbed to the roof of Amundsen-Scott station&#x27;s Dark Sector Laboratory to watch.

One of the more unusual places here on Earth occurs inside Death Valley, California, USA.  There a dried lakebed named Racetrack Playa exists that is almost perfectly flat, with the odd exception of some very large stones, one of which is pictured here in April of 2019 beneath a dark, Milky-Way filled sky.  Now the flatness and texture of large playa like Racetrack are fascinating but not scientifically puzzling -- they are caused by mud flowing, drying, and cracking after a heavy rain.  Only recently, however, has a viable scientific hypothesis been given to explain how heavy  sailing stones end up near the middle of such a large flat surface.  Unfortunately, as frequently happens in science, a seemingly surreal problem ends up having a relatively mundane solution.  It turns out that in winter thin floating ice sheets form in a rare ephemeral lake, and light winds push ice sections that then push even heavy rocks across the temporarily flooded playa when sunlight begins to melt the ice.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2004/SailingStone_Burke_1366.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Sailing Stone across Death Valley&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2004/SailingStone_Burke_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Yuri Beletsky&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2013-06-15&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Over a five hour period last Tuesday morning, exposures captured this tantalizing view of meteor streaks and the Milky Way in dark skies above Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. During that time, astronomers had hoped to see an outburst from the gamma Delphinid meteor shower as Earth swept through the dust trail left by an unknown comet. Named for the shower&#x27;s radiant point in the constellation Delphinus, a brief but strong outburst was reported in bright, moonlit skies on June 10, 1930. While no strong Delphinid meteor activity was reported since, an outburst was tentatively predicted to occur again in 2013. But even though Tuesday&#x27;s skies were dark, the overall rate of meteors in this field is low, and only the three lower meteor streaks seem to point back to the shower&#x27;s estimated radiant.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1306/delphinids_lcBeletsky.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Delphinid Meteor Mystery&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1306/delphinids_lcBeletsky900.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Stephane Guisard&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2020-07-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Comet dust falls through a twilight sky in this dream-like scene, but it&#x27;s not part of a fairytale movie. Still, Castle Neuschwanstein, nestled in the Bavarian Alps, did inspire Disneyland&#x27;s Sleeping Beauty Castle. Captured on July 20, the bright streak above the castle towers is likely a Perseid meteor. Though it peaks near mid-August, the annual summer meteor shower is active now. The meteor trail over the fairytale castle can be traced back to the shower&#x27;s radiant in the heroic constellation Perseus off the top right of the frame. Perseid meteors are produced by dust from periodic Comet Swift-Tuttle. With its own broad dust tail now sweeping through northern skies the celestial apparition above the distant horizon is planet Earth&#x27;s current darling, Comet NEOWISE.

The closer cluster&#x27;s gravity will act like a huge lens, pulling images of the distant galaxy around the sides and greatly distorting them.  This is just the case observed in the above recently released image from the VLT.  The cluster CL2244-02 is composed of many yellow galaxies and is lensing the image of a blue-white background galaxy into a huge arc.  Careful inspection of the image will reveal at least one other lensed background galaxy appearing in red.  The foreground cluster can only create such a smooth arc if most of its mass is smoothly distributed dark matter - and therefore not concentrated in the yellow galaxies visible.  Analyzing these gravitational arcs gives astronomers a method to estimate the dark matter distribution in clusters of galaxies.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9901/cl2244_vlt_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ring Around the Cluster&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9901/cl2244_vlt.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nNordic Optical Telescope\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;1998-09-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Saturn is the second largest planet in our Solar System. Saturn has been easily visible in the sky since history has been recorded.  Galileo used one of the first telescopes in 1610 to discover Saturn&#x27;s rings, which he first thought were moons.  Maxwell showed in 1856 that Saturn&#x27;s rings couldn&#x27;t be a single solid, since Saturn&#x27;s own gravity would break it up.  Were Saturn&#x27;s rings assembled into a single body, it would measure less than 100 kilometers across.  The origin of Saturn&#x27;s rings, and of unusual radial patterns that appear on them called spokes, are still unknown. The above representative-color picture was taken from Earth in infrared light. A robot spacecraft Cassini launched in 1997 will reach Saturn in 2004.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9809/saturn_not_big.gif&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Saturn from Earth&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9809/saturn_not.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Nuits sacrees&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2017-08-30&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What was happening in the sky during last week&#x27;s total solar eclipse?  This featured little-planet, all-sky, double time-lapse, digitally-fused composite captured celestial action during both night and day from a single location. In this 360x180 panorama, north and south are at the image bottom and top, while east and west are at the left and right edges, respectively.  During four hours the night before the eclipse, star trails were captured circling the north celestial pole (bottom) as the Earth spun.  During the day of the total eclipse, the Sun was captured every fifteen minutes from sunrise to sunset (top), sometimes in partial eclipse. All of these images were then digitally merged onto a single image taken exactly during the total solar eclipse.  Then, the Sun&#x27;s bright corona could be seen flaring around the dark new Moon (upper left), while Venus simultaneously became easily visible (top).  The tree in the middle, below the camera, is a Douglas fir. The images were taken with care and planning at  Magone Lake in Oregon, USA.

Besides the sun and moon, Venus is the brightest object visible in Earth&#x27;s sky. This month, Venus appears in early evening near the red planet Mars and Mars&#x27; red giant rival Antares above the southwestern horizon. Because it is closer to the sun than Earth, Venus never strays far from the sun in its apparent position and is seen during the year as either a bright morning or evening star. This beautiful sunset imaged from low earth orbit by the Atlantis space shuttle crew in May 1989 also reveals the planet Venus blazing above Earth&#x27;s horizon. It is a fitting image for this mission and crew. It was recorded following the successful release of the robot Venus-explorer Magellan, the first planetary probe to be deployed from a space shuttle.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9710/venus_sts30_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Venus On The Horizon&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9710/venus_sts30.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nRogelio Bernal\nAndreo (Deep Sky Colors) \n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2017-06-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What surrounds the famous belt stars of Orion? A deep exposure shows everything from dark nebula to star clusters, all embedded in an extended patch of gaseous wisps in the greater Orion Molecular Cloud Complex.  The brightest three stars, appearing diagonally on the left of the featured image are indeed the famous three stars that make up the belt of Orion.  Just below Alnitak, the lowest of the three belt stars, is the Flame Nebula, glowing with excited hydrogen gas and immersed in filaments of dark brown dust.  Just to the right of Alnitak lies the Horsehead Nebula, a  dark indentation of dense dust that has perhaps the most recognized nebular shapes on the sky. The dark molecular cloud, roughly 1,500 light years distant, is cataloged as Barnard 33 and is seen primarily because it is backlit by the nearby massive star Sigma Orionis. The Horsehead Nebula will slowly shift its apparent shape over the next few million years and will eventually be destroyed by the high-energy starlight.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1706/orionbfh_andreo_1089.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Orion: Belt, Flame, and Horsehead&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1706/orionbfh_andreo_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;1995-06-28&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Today&#x27;s Picture: June 28, 1995    The Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula  Picture Credit: NASA, Hubble Space Telescope  Explanation:  Three thousand light years away, a dying star throws off shells of glowing gas. This Hubble Space Telescope image reveals \&quot;The Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula\&quot; to be one of the most complex \&quot;planetary nebulae\&quot; known. In fact, the features seen in this image are so complex that astronomers suspect the visible central star may actually be a double star system. The term planetary nebula, used to describe this general class of objects, is misleading. Although these objects may appear round and planet-like in small telescopes, high resolution images reveal them to be stars surrounded by cocoons of gas blown off in the late stages of evolution.

Operating on the Martian surface into the early 1980s, the Vikings took thousands of pictures, conducted sophisticated chemical searches for life and studied the Martian weather and geology. In the dramatically detailed image above, a field of rocks and boulders is viewed from the Viking 1 landing sight on Chryse Planitia (the Plain of Chryse). Viking 1&#x27;s dusty foot pad is just visible at the lower right. The image was created by combining high resolution black and white images with lower resolution color images of the same area.

But, taken in dark skies over Namibia, this image reveals a stunning aspect of the shy constellation -- a field of dusty nebulae and colorful stars. Blue reflection nebulae are scattered through the scene, but most eye-catching is the complex of silvery dust clouds that only faintly reflect starlight, punctuated by dense dark nebulae. The dark nebulae stand out because they block out background stars.

Named Valles Marineris, the grand valley extends over 3,000 kilometers long, spans as much as 600 kilometers across, and delves as much as 8 kilometers deep.  By comparison, the Earth&#x27;s Grand Canyon in Arizona, USA is 800 kilometers long, 30 kilometers across, and 1.8 kilometers deep.  The origin of the Valles Marineris remains unknown, although a leading hypothesis holds that it started as a crack billions of years ago as the planet cooled.

A member of the Dorado galaxy group, the island universe lies a mere 50 million light-years away. The galactic disk of NGC 1546 is tilted to our line-of-sight, with the yellowish light of the old stars and bluish regions of newly formed stars shining through the galaxy&#x27;s dust lanes.

What used to be considered a hole in the sky is now known to astronomers as a dark molecular cloud.  Here, a high concentration of dust and molecular gas absorb practically all the visible light emitted from background stars.  The eerily dark surroundings help make the interiors of molecular clouds some of the coldest and most isolated places in the universe.  One of the most notable of these dark absorption nebulae is a cloud toward the constellation Ophiuchus known as Barnard 68, pictured above.  That no stars are visible in the center indicates that Barnard 68 is relatively nearby, with measurements placing it about 500 light-years away and half a light-year across.  It is not known exactly how molecular clouds like Barnard 68 form, but it is known that these clouds are themselves likely places for new stars to form.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/barnard68_vlt_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Molecular Cloud Barnard 68&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/barnard68_vlt.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2002-02-24&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Sir Isaac Newton changed the world.  Born in 1642, Newton was only an above-average student.  But he went home from Cambridge one summer in 1665, thought a lot about the physical nature of the world, and came back two years later with a revolutionary understanding of mathematics, gravitation, and optics.  A Professor of his, upon understanding what Newton had done, resigned his own position at Cambridge so Newton could have it.  Newton&#x27;s calculus provided a new mathematical framework for the rapid solution of whole classes of physical problems.  Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation explained in one simple formula how apples fall and planets move.

While the Perseid meteor shower is scheduled to peak over the next few days, bright light from a gibbous Moon will also flood the early evening and mask the majority of relatively faint meteors. Still, skygazing in the early morning after the Moon sets (after about 2 AM local time) could reveal many faint meteors.  Persistant observing at any time after sunset can reward northern hemisphere watchers looking for occasional Perseid fireballs. Astronomer Jimmy Westlake imaged this bright Perseid meteor despite the combination of moonlight and auroral glow over Colorado skies in August of 2000.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0808/PerseidMoonlightAurora9_westlake_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Aurora Persei&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0808/PerseidMoonlightAurora9_westlake.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;1997-09-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s picture: Half Dome Rock on Mars&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9709/jupfam1_galvg_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jupiter And Family&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9709/jupfam1_galvg.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;J.

Strewn throughout the universe are \&quot;trees\&quot; of hydrogen gas that absorb light from distant objects. These gas clouds leave numerous absorption lines in a distant quasar&#x27;s spectra, together called the Lyman-alpha forest. Distant quasars appear to be absorbed by many more Lyman-alpha clouds than nearby quasars, indicating a Lyman-alpha thicket early in our universe. The above image depicts one possible computer realization of how Lyman-alpha clouds were distributed at a redshift of 3. Each side of the box measures 30 million light-years across.

Consider this beautiful triple conjunction of Moon, Jupiter and Saturn captured through clouds in the wintry twilight. The telephoto view looks toward the western horizon and the Alborz Mountains in Iran after sunset on December 17. The celestial gathering makes it easy to see Jupiter and fainter Saturn are separated on that date by roughly the diameter of the waxing crescent Moon. On the day of their Great Conjunction, solstice day December 21, Jupiter and Saturn may seem to nearly merge though. In their closest conjunction in 400 years they will be separated on the sky by only about 1/5 the apparent diameter of the Moon. By then the two largest worlds in the Solar System and their moons will be sharing the same field of view in telescopes around planet Earth.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2012/ConjunctionPanorama1-S2.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Conjunction after Sunset&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2012/ConjunctionPanorama1-S2_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nJose Pedrero\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2023-08-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;It came from outer space. It -- in this case a sand-sized bit of a comet nucleus -- was likely ejected many years ago from Sun-orbiting Comet Swift-Tuttle, but then continued to orbit the Sun alone.  When the Earth crossed through this orbit, the piece of comet debris impacted the atmosphere of our fair planet and was seen as a meteor. This meteor deteriorated, causing gases to be emitted that glowed in colors emitted by its component elements. The featured image was taken last week from Castilla La Mancha, Spain, during the peak night of the Perseids meteor shower.  The picturesque meteor streak happened to appear in the only one of 50 frames that also included the Andromeda galaxy. Stars dot the frame, each much further away than the meteor. Compared to the stars, the Andromeda galaxy (M31) is, again, much further away.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2308/M31Perseid_Pedrero_3232.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Meteor and the Galaxy&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2308/M31Perseid_Pedrero_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Russell Croman&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2004-03-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Look up into the sky tonight, and even with a good telescope you won&#x27;t come across a sight quite like this one. It is a familiar object though, the grand stellar nursery known as the Orion Nebula. But the striking picture combines images taken through three separate filters, each designed to record different emission lines - light from Sulfur, Oxygen, and Hydrogen atoms glowing in the tenuous nebular gas. At such low densities, Sulfur and Hydrogen atoms emit red colors while Oxygen glows green. To distinguish their contributions in the final image, Sulfur was assigned to red, Hydrogen to green, and Oxygen to blue, a color scheme used in mapped-color images of other astronomical nebulae as well. While the result is very different from what the eye might see, the image is still both beautiful and scientifically valuable, tracing elements and conditions within the nearby star forming region.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0403/m42mapped_croman_full.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;An Orion of a Different Color&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0403/m42mapped_croman_c1.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2003-07-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Almost on cue, as Mars nears its closest approach to planet Earth in recorded history, ominous seasonal dust storms are beginning to kick up. Observers worry that the activity may presage the development of a planet wide dust storm, frustrating attempts to view Mars in the coming months, a situation similar to the Red Planet&#x27;s uncooperative behavior in 2001. In this example, recorded in mid-May by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft camera, a dust storm the size of a continent sweeps north and east (toward the upper right) across Mars&#x27; northern Acidalia Planitia. Meanwhile, interplanetary robotic explorers Mars Express/ Beagle 2, Nozomi, and the twin Mars Exploration Rovers Opportunity and Spirit, are all bound for Mars and should arrive by early January 2004.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0307/acidaliamars_mgs_full.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Dust Storm Over Northern Mars&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0307/acidaliamars_mgs_c1.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;AAO&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2002-12-01&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;It is the most famous star cluster on the sky. The Pleiades can be seen without binoculars from even the depths of a light-polluted city.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades is one of the brightest and closest open clusters.   The Pleiades contains over 3000 stars, is about 400 light years away, and only 13 light years across.  Quite evident in the above photograph are the blue reflection nebulae that surround the bright cluster stars.  Low mass, faint, brown dwarfs have recently been found in the Pleiades.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/pleiades_aao_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Pleiades Star Cluster&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/pleiades_aao.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;1998-01-13&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This year&#x27;s El Ni\u00f1o is the strongest ever recorded.  The large amount of warm water in the Pacific Ocean near the equator is causing unusual weather all over planet Earth.  The above false-color images of Earth show the relative levels of warm water between normal (upper left) and the comparatively mild El Ni\u00f1o of 1995 - 1996. Red indicates a high water level.  Detailed measurements of this years El Ni\u00f1o indicate the warm water level is rising and falling in rhythmic fashion, possibly in response to changing wind patterns.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9801/elnino4_jpl_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;El Ni\u00f1o Water Rhythm&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9801/elnino4_jpl.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2006-11-07&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Janus is one of the stranger moons of Saturn.  First, Janus travels in an unusual orbit around Saturn where it periodically trades places with its sister moon Epimetheus, which typically orbits about 50 kilometers away.   Janus, although slightly larger than Epimetheus, is potato-shaped and has a largest diameter of about 190 kilometers.  Next, Janus is covered with large craters but strangely appears to lack small craters.  One possible reason for this is a fine dust that might cover the small moon, a surface also hypothesized for Pandora and Telesto.   Pictured above, Janus was captured in front of the cloud tops of Saturn in late September.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/janus_cassini_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Janus: Potato Shaped Moon of Saturn&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/janus_cassini.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nTony Hallas\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2007-07-19&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;These are galaxies of the Hercules Cluster, an archipelago of island universes a mere 500 million light-years away. Also known as Abell 2151, this cluster is loaded with gas and dust rich, star-forming spiral galaxies but has relatively few elliptical galaxies, which lack gas and dust and the associated newborn stars. The colors in this remarkably deep composite image clearly show the star forming galaxies with a blue tint and galaxies with older stellar populations with a yellowish cast. The sharp picture spans about 1/2 degree across the cluster center, corresponding to over 4 million light-years at the cluster&#x27;s estimated distance. In the cosmic vista many galaxies seem to be colliding or merging while others seem distorted - clear evidence that cluster galaxies commonly interact. In fact, the Hercules Cluster itself may be seen as the result of ongoing mergers of smaller galaxy clusters and is thought to be similar to young galaxy clusters in the much more distant, early Universe.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0707/A2151LRGB_hallasF.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Hercules Cluster of Galaxies&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0707/A2151LRGB_hallas_c800.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Nagy Attila&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2010-02-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever seen a halo around the Sun?  This fairly common sight occurs when high thin clouds containing millions of tiny ice crystals cover much of the sky.  Each ice crystal acts like a miniature lens.  Because most of the crystals have a similar elongated hexagonal shape, light entering one crystal face and exiting through the opposing face refracts 22 degrees, which corresponds to the radius of the Sun halo.  A similar Moon halo may be visible during the night.  Pictured above, a nearly complete sun halo was photographed high above the ancient Bayon temple in Angkor, Cambodia. Exactly how ice-crystals form in clouds remains under investigation.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1002/sunhalo_attila_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Sun Halo Over Cambodia&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1002/sunhalo_attila.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Michael Bessell \n(RSAA, ANU), \nMSO\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2001-04-24&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The nebula surrounding bright star S Mon is filled with dark dust and glowing gas.  The strange shapes that haunt this star forming region originate from fine interstellar dust reacting in complex ways to the energetic light and hot gas being expelled by the young stars.  The above picture, in representative color, isolates the northern part of a greater nebula designated NGC 2264, which lies about 2500 light-years away and includes the Cone Nebula.  The blue glow directly surrounding S Mon results from reflection, where neighboring dust reflects light from the bright star.  The more diffuse red glow results from emission, where starlight ionizes hydrogen gas.  Pink areas are lit by a combination of the two processes.  A small group of stars surrounds S Mon, the brightest star in the picture and a star visible with the naked eye toward the constellation of Monoceros.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0104/n2264n_bessell.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 2264: Stars, Dust, and Gas&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0104/n2264n_bessell_big.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2020-02-15&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A jewel of the southern sky, the Great Carina Nebula, also known as NGC 3372, spans over 300 light-years, one of our galaxy&#x27;s largest star forming regions. Like the smaller, more northerly Great Orion Nebula, the Carina Nebula is easily visible to the unaided eye, though at a distance of 7,500 light-years it is some 5 times farther away. This gorgeous telescopic close-up reveals remarkable details of the region&#x27;s central glowing filaments of interstellar gas and obscuring cosmic dust clouds in a field of view nearly 20 light-years across. The Carina Nebula is home to young, extremely massive stars, including the still enigmatic and violently variable Eta Carinae, a star system with well over 100 times the mass of the Sun. In the processed composite of space and ground-based image data a dusty, two-lobed Homunculus Nebula appears to surround Eta Carinae itself just below and left of center. While Eta Carinae is likely on the verge of a supernova explosion, X-ray images indicate that the Great Carina Nebula has been a veritable supernova factory.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2002/Eta-HST-ESO-New-LL.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Carina Nebula Close Up&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2002/Eta-HST-ESO-New-LL1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Mike Selby&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Point your telescope toward the high flying constellation Pegasus and you can find this cosmic expanse of Milky Way stars and distant galaxies. NGC 7814 is centered in the sharp field of view that would almost be covered by a full moon. NGC 7814 is sometimes called the Little Sombrero for its resemblance to the brighter more famous M104, the Sombrero Galaxy. Both Sombrero and Little Sombrero are spiral galaxies seen edge-on, and both have extensive halos and central bulges cut by a thin disk with thinner dust lanes in silhouette. In fact, NGC 7814 is some 40 million light-years away and an estimated 60,000 light-years across. That actually makes the Little Sombrero about the same physical size as its better known namesake, appearing smaller and fainter only because it is farther away.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/NGC_7814_LRGB_crop-rev-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 7814: Little Sombrero&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/NGC_7814_crop-rev-1_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2008-08-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Active galaxy NGC 1275 is the central, dominant member of the large and relatively nearby Perseus Cluster of Galaxies. A prodigious source of x-rays and radio emission, NGC 1275 accretes matter as entire galaxies fall into it, ultimately feeding a supermassive black hole at the galaxy&#x27;s core. This stunning visible light image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows galactic debris and filaments of glowing gas, some up to 20,000 light-years long. The filaments persist in NGC 1275, even though the turmoil of galactic collisions should destroy them.  What keeps the filaments together? Recent work indicates that the structures, pushed out from the galaxy&#x27;s center by the black hole&#x27;s activity, are held together by magnetic fields. To add x-ray data from the Chandra Observatory and radio data from the Very Large Array to the Hubble image, just slide your cursor over the picture. In the resulting composite, x-rays highlight the shells of hot gas surrounding the center of the galaxy, with radio emission filling giant bubble-shaped cavities. Also known as Perseus A, NGC 1275 spans over 100,000 light years and lies about 230 million light years away.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0808/ngc1275_web.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Active Galaxy NGC 1275&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0808/ngc1275_web59.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2009-05-05&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;When orbiting Saturn, be sure to watch for breathtaking superpositions of moons and rings.  One such picturesque vista was visible recently to the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn.  In 2006 April, Cassini captured Saturn&#x27;s A and F rings stretching in front of cloud-shrouded Titan.  Near the rings and appearing just above Titan was Epimetheus, a moon which orbits just outside the F ring. The dark space in the A ring is called the Encke Gap, although several thin knotted ringlets and even the small moon Pan orbit there. Cassini and curious Earthlings await the coming Saturnian equinox this summer when the ring plane will point directly at the Sun.  Mysterious spokes and telling shadows are expected to become visible that might give away more clues about the nature of Saturn&#x27;s ring particles.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0905/titanrings_cassini_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Titan Beyond the Rings&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0905/titanrings_cassini.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Bob Franke&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-06-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Three objects stand out in this thoughtful telescopic image, a view toward the mostly stealthy constellation Lynx. The two brightest (the spiky ones) are nearby stars. The third is the remote globular star cluster NGC 2419, at distance of nearly 300,000 light-years. NGC 2419 is sometimes called \&quot;the Intergalactic Wanderer\&quot;, an appropriate title considering that the distance to the Milky Way&#x27;s satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, is only about 160,000 light-years. Roughly similar to other large globular star clusters like Omega Centauri, NGC 2419 is itself intrinsically bright, but appears faint because it is so far away. NGC 2419 may really have an extragalactic origin as, for example, the remains of a small galaxy captured and disrupted by the Milky Way. But its extreme distance makes it difficult to study and compare its properties with other globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1506/ngc2419Frankebig.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 2419: Intergalactic Wanderer&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1506/ngc2419Franke.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adam Block&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2005-04-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;M7 is one of the most prominent open clusters of stars on the sky.

In the early 1990s, though, using imaging radar, NASA&#x27;s Venus-orbiting Magellan spacecraft was able to lift the veil from the face of Venus and produced spectacular high resolution images of the planet&#x27;s surface.  Colors used in this computer generated picture of Magellan radar data are based on color images from the surface of Venus transmitted by the Soviet Venera 13 and 14 landers.

The large circular feature on the upper right, called Galileo Regio, is an ancient region of unknown origin. Ganymede is thought to have an ocean layer that contains more water than Earth and might contain life. Like Earth&#x27;s Moon, Ganymede keeps the same face towards its central planet, in this case Jupiter. The featured image was taken about 20 years ago by NASA&#x27;s Galileo probe, which ended its mission by diving into Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere in 2003.

Mars has seasons too and for the same reason that Earth does -- like Earth, Mars&#x27; axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the plane of its orbit around the sun. Eleven days ago Autumn also came to Mars&#x27; Northern Hemisphere and the Hubble Space Telescope recorded this image of the red planet to look for seasonal changes in the Martian weather. Clouds appear to cover the north polar regions while a dust storm rages in the south. The subject of weather on Mars is important to the just arrived Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft as it uses the innovative technique of aerobraking to establish a suitable mapping orbit around Mars.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9709/mars1_hst_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Martian Autumn Begins&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9709/mars1_hst.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2008-01-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Perhaps it&#x27;s time to go inside.  Such thoughts might occur to people witnessing the approach of an impressive shelf cloud.  Shelf clouds are typically seen leading thunderstorms, although they may precede any well defined front of relatively cold air.  Shelf clouds differ from roll clouds because shelf clouds are attached to a larger cloud system lurking above.  Similarly, shelf clouds differ from wall clouds because wall clouds typically trail storm systems.  The above pictured shelf cloud was photographed toward the southwest during a trip crossing the prairies of Saskatchewan, Canada on the Trans-Canada Highway in 2001 August.  A rising Sun illuminated the impressive cloud from the east as it advanced from the west.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0801/shelfcloud_kerr_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Shelf Cloud Over Saskatchewan&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0801/shelfcloud_kerr.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Rogelio Bernal Andreo&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2013-08-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This intriguing monument can be found in Taiwan between the cities of Hualian and Taitong. Split into two sides, it straddles a special circle of latitude on planet Earth, near 23.5 degrees north, known as the Tropic of Cancer. Points along the Tropic of Cancer are the northernmost locations where the Sun can pass directly overhead, an event that occurs once a year during the northern hemisphere&#x27;s summer solstice. The latitude that defines the Tropic of Cancer corresponds to the tilt of planet Earth&#x27;s rotation axis with respect to its orbital plane. The name refers to the zodiacal constellation Cancer the Crab. Historically the Sun&#x27;s position was within Cancer during the northern summer solstice, but because of the precession of Earth&#x27;s axis, that solstice Sun is currently within the boundaries of Taurus. In this starry night scene the otherwise all white structure is colored by city lights, with its orange side just south of the Tropic of Cancer and the white side just north. Of course, there is a southern hemisphere counterpart of the Tropic of Cancer. It&#x27;s called the Tropic of Capricorn.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1308/TOCTaiwan_andreo.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1308/TOCTaiwan_andreo900.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-11-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Get out your red/blue glasses and check out this stereo scene from Taurus-Littrow valley on the Moon!

The supernova remnant, known as Cassiopeia A, was produced when a star exploded around 300 years ago in this northern sky constellation. It is revealed here in unprecedented detail in the light of X-rays - photons with thousands of times the energy of visible light. Shock waves expanding at 10 million miles-per-hour are seen to have heated this 10 light-year diameter bubble of stellar debris to X-ray emitting temperatures of 50 million kelvins. The tantalizing bright speck near the bubble&#x27;s center could well be the dense, hot remnant of the stellar core collapsed to form a newborn neutron star. With this and other first light images, the Chandra Observatory is still undergoing check out operations in preparation for its much anticipated exploration of the X-ray sky.

The multiple layers of emission appear strangely complex and unexpected given the relatively featureless appearance of the elliptical galaxy in less deep images. The cause of the shells is currently unknown, but possibly tidal tails related to debris left over from absorbing numerous small galaxies in the past billion years. Alternatively the shells may be like ripples in a pond, where the ongoing collision with the spiral galaxy just above NGC 474 is causing density waves to ripple though the galactic giant. Regardless of the actual cause, the above image dramatically highlights the increasing consensus that at least some elliptical galaxies have formed in the recent past, and that the outer halos of most large galaxies are not really smooth but have complexities induced by frequent interactions with -- and accretions of -- smaller nearby galaxies. The halo of our own Milky Way Galaxy is one example of such unexpected complexity. NGC 474 spans about 250,000 light years and lies about 100 million light years distant toward the constellation of the Fish (Pisces).   APOD Lecture and Star Party: This Friday night at Ft.

Normally, cloud bottoms are flat. The flatness is caused by moist warm air that rises and cools and so condenses into water droplets at a specific temperature, which usually corresponds to a very specific height.  As water droplets grow, an opaque cloud forms.  Under some conditions, however, cloud pockets can develop that contain large droplets of water or ice that fall into clear air as they evaporate.  Such pockets may occur in turbulent air near a thunderstorm.  Resulting mammatus clouds can appear especially dramatic if sunlit from the side.  These mammatus clouds were photographed over Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada during the summer of 2012.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1510/mammatus_lindsay_1280.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mammatus Clouds Over Saskatchewan&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1510/mammatus_lindsay_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Get out your red/blue glasses and float next to Helene, small, icy moon of Saturn. Appropriately named, Helene is a Trojan moon, so called because it orbits at a Lagrange point. A Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position near two massive bodies, in this case Saturn and larger moon Dione. In fact, irregularly shaped ( about 36 by 32 by 30 kilometers) Helene orbits at Dione&#x27;s leading Lagrange point while brotherly ice moon Polydeuces follows at Dione&#x27;s trailing Lagrange point. The sharp stereo anaglyph was constructed from two Cassini images captured during a close flyby in 2011.

Presently Pluto&#x27;s smallest and dimmest known moon, P4 is estimated to be 13 to 34 kilometers across.

The above recently-released, false-color image taken by the giant Subaru Telescope shows details of  giant halos of diffuse gas that are seen to envelop the entire structure.  The Ring Nebula, also known as M57, is an elongated planetary nebula, a type of nebula that is created when a Sun-like star evolves to throw off its outer atmosphere and becomes a white dwarf.

The featured picture, an attempt to show how Io would appear in the \&quot;true colors\&quot; perceptible to the average human eye, was taken in 1999 July by the Galileo spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003.  Io&#x27;s colors derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock.  The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes.  The intense tidal gravity of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter&#x27;s other Galilean moons.  The resulting friction greatly heats Io&#x27;s interior, causing  molten rock to explode through the surface.  Io&#x27;s volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.  Some of Io&#x27;s volcanic lava is so hot it glows in the dark.

For example, Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot is a hurricane-like storm system at least twice the diameter of planet Earth. Approaching Jupiter in early October the Cassini spacecraft recorded the images used in this excellent movie of the swirling storm system and planet-circling cloud bands. Seven mosaicked frames make up the movie sequence, each separated by one or two rotation periods (Jupiter rotates about once every 10 hours). The sequence is viewed as a simple cylindrical map projection spanning 50 degrees north to 50 degrees south of the Jovian equator. Can you see the small bright \&quot;clouds\&quot; which seem to suddenly appear west (left) of the Red Spot? Data from the Galileo spacecraft, orbiting Jupiter since 1996, suggest that these features are large lightning storms. Saturn-bound, the Cassini spacecraft will take a few months to fly by Jupiter, coordinating Jovian explorations with Galileo and picking up speed for the final leg of its interplanetary journey.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0011/redspot_cassini.gif&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cassini At Jupiter: Red Spot Movie&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0011/redspot_cassini.gif&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;1998-05-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Astronomers have discovered that looking at dust along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy is a bit like looking into a frothy glass of beer.

This processed infrared image, based on data from NASA&#x27;s IRAS satellite, maps the radiation from the edges of galactic dust clouds and reveals the complex distribution.

NASA&#x27;s science programs have produced the robotic exploration of our Solar System, views of the Universe across the electromagnetic spectrum, and valuable meteorological and remote-sensing Earth observations. At birth, NASA&#x27;s priorities were largely driven by the pressures and competitions of the Cold War. But looking back over 40 years, the sum of its accomplishments have produced needed new technologies and a vital new perspective on Planet Earth and the Cosmos.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9810/launch_sts91_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Happy 40th Birthday, NASA!&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9810/launch_sts91.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2012-03-18&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;It was visible around the world. The sunset conjunction of Jupiter and Venus was visible last week almost no matter where you lived on Earth.  Anyone on the planet with a clear western horizon at sunset could see them. This week the two are still notable, even though Jupiter has sunk below the brighter Venus. And if you look higher in the sky you can see Mars as well. Pictured above, a creative photographer traveled away from the town lights of Szubin, Poland to image a near closest approach of the two planets almost a week ago. The bright planets were separated only by three degrees and his daughter striking a humorous pose. A faint red sunset still glowed in the background. Although this conjunction is drawing to a close, another conjunction between Venus and Jupiter will occur next May.

As a result, two fuzzy cloud-like objects easily visible to southern hemisphere skygazers are known as the Clouds of Magellan, now understood to be satellite galaxies of our much larger, spiral Milky Way galaxy. About 160,000 light-years distant in the constellation Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is seen here in a remarkably deep, colorful, and annotated composite image. Spanning about 15,000 light-years or so, it is the most massive of the Milky Way&#x27;s satellite galaxies and is the home of the closest supernova in modern times, SN 1987A.  The prominent patch just left of center is 30 Doradus, also known as the magnificent Tarantula Nebula, is a giant star-forming region about 1,000 light-years across.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1305/lmc_comolli_1024.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Large Cloud of Magellan&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1305/lmc_comolli_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2011-10-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;It is difficult to hide a galaxy behind a cluster of galaxies. The closer cluster&#x27;s gravity will act like a huge lens, pulling images of the distant galaxy around the sides and greatly distorting them. This is just the case observed in the above recently released image from the CLASH survey with the Hubble Space Telescope. The cluster MACS J1206.2-0847 is composed of many galaxies and is lensing the image of a yellow-red background galaxy into the huge arc on the right. Careful inspection of the image will reveal at least several other lensed background galaxies -- many appearing as elongated wisps. The foreground cluster can only create such smooth arcs if most of its mass is smoothly distributed dark matter -- and therefore not concentrated in the cluster galaxies visible. Analyzing the positions of these gravitational arcs also gives astronomers a method to estimate the dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters, and infer from that when these huge conglomerations of galaxies began to form.

The picture was made by a group of experienced astrophotographers who traveled there to take advantage of the ideal observing conditions near La Palma&#x27;s Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos. Skygazers can easily pick out several of their favorite astronomical objects in this wide angle time exposure which covers about 40 degrees on winter the sky. Faint stars along the plane of our Galaxy compose the delicate, luminous band of the Milky Way stretching across the image from the bottom left. The familiar constellation of Orion the hunter is also easy to find, with glowing nebulae highlighting the hunter&#x27;s belt and sword. Orion&#x27;s famous red giant star Betelgeuse, near picture center, has a yellowish cast and Rigel is the bright star in Orion at lower right. Brilliant white Sirius, near the bottom, is the brightest star in the picture (and in Earth&#x27;s night sky). Sirius, is part of the constellation Canis Major (Big Dog). Across the Milky Way, above and to the left of Sirius, is slightly less brilliant Procyon, brightest star of Canis Minor.

Diving into the inner Solar System at an odd angle, this large dirty iceberg will pass its closest to the Sun -- between the orbits of Mercury and Venus -- in just two days. Long camera exposures are now capturing C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS), sometimes abbreviated as just A3, and its dust tail before and during sunrise.  The featured image composite was taken four days ago and captured the comet as it rose above Lake George, NSW, Australia.  Vertical bands further left are images of the comet as the rising Sun made the predawn sky increasingly bright and colorful. Just how bright the comet will become over the next month is currently unknown as it involves how much gas and dust the comet&#x27;s nucleus will expel. Optimistic skywatchers are hoping for a great show where Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS creates dust and ion tails visible across Earth&#x27;s sky and becomes known as the Great Comet of 2024.

Likely a satellite companion of the Local Group&#x27;s dominant player, the large spiral Andromeda (M31), the Pegasus dwarf galaxy is almost hidden in the glare of relatively bright foreground stars in our own Milkyway. Still, this dramatic Keck telescope 3-color image reveals Peg dSph as a clump of fainter, bluer stars 2,000 or so light-years across. Excitement over discoveries of Peg dSph and other nearby dwarf galaxies reflects the fact that little galaxies may loom large in the process of galaxy evolution. They are thought to be the building blocks from which larger galaxies are constructed.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9901/pegdsph_grebel_big.gif&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Pegasus dSph: Little Galaxy of the Local Group&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9901/pegdsph_grebel.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-09-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How different are space and time at very small scales?  To explore the unfamiliar domain of the miniscule Planck scale -- where normally unnoticeable quantum effects might become dominant -- a newly developed instrument called the Fermilab Holometer has begun operating at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) near Chicago, Illinois, USA. The instrument seeks to determine if slight but simultaneous jiggles of a mirror in two directions expose a fundamental type of holographic noise that always exceeds a minimum amount. Pictured above is one of the end mirrors of a Holometer prototype. Although the discovery of holographic noise would surely be groundbreaking, the dependence of such noise on a specific laboratory length scale would surprise some spacetime enthusiasts. One reason for this is the Lorentz Invariance postulate of Einstein&#x27;s special relativity, which states that all length scales should appear contracted to a relatively moving observer -- even the diminutive Planck length.  Still, the experiment is unique and many are curious what the results will show.

This mosaic of Hubble Space Telescope images taken in blue, green, and red light has been processed to present a natural color picture of this cosmic maelstrom. Infrared images from the Hubble have also shown that hidden at the center of this activity are what seem to be disks of matter spiraling into a black hole with a billion times the mass of the Sun! Centaurus A itself is apparently the result of a collision of two galaxies and the left over debris is steadily being consumed by the black hole. Astronomers believe that such black hole \&quot;central engines\&quot; generate the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray energy radiated by Centaurus A and other active galaxies. But for an active galaxy Centaurus A is close, a mere 10 million light-years away, and is a relatively convenient laboratory for exploring these powerful sources of energy.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9805/cena_wfpc2_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Center of Centaurus A&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9805/cena_wfpc2.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nBrad Goldpaint  \n(Goldpaint Photography) \n\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-08-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Where are all of these meteors coming from?  In terms of direction on the sky, the pointed answer is the constellation of Perseus.  That is why the meteor shower that peaks later this week is known as the Perseids -- the meteors all appear to came from a radiant toward Perseus. In terms of parent body, though, the sand-sized debris that makes up the Perseids meteors come from Comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet follows a well-defined orbit around our Sun, and the part of the orbit that approaches Earth is superposed in front of the Perseus. Therefore, when Earth crosses this orbit, the radiant point of falling debris appears in Perseus. Featured here, a composite image containing over 60 meteors from last August&#x27;s Perseids meteor shower shows many bright meteors that streaked over Mount Shasta, California, USA.

These particles form a previously unknown ring halo, recently discovered by the robot spacecraft Galileo currently orbiting Jupiter.  Galileo obtained this image when on the far side of Jupiter - from this orientation scattered sunlight makes the halo ring visible.  The amount of scattering indicates that halo particles are very small - perhaps 100 times smaller than the width of a human hair.  Particles this small are believed to survive only for years, and so must somehow be replenished to Jupiter&#x27;s ancient ring system.  One possible explanation for this unusual halo is that electromagnetic fields around Jupiter gently push small charged particles out of the ring plane.  This false color image has been artificially stretched in the vertical direction to highlight the ring halo.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9708/jupringhalo_gal_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Ring Halo&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9708/jupringhalo_gal.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nLucy Orloski\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2006-01-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever seen a sun pillar?  When the air is cold and the Sun is rising or setting, falling ice crystals can reflect sunlight and create an unusual column of light.  Ice sometimes forms flat, six-sided shaped crystals as it falls from high-level clouds.  Air resistance causes these crystals to lie nearly flat much of the time as they flutter to the ground.  Sunlight reflects off crystals that are properly aligned, creating the sun-pillar effect.  In the above picture taken late last month, a sun-pillar reflects light from a Sun setting over Bangor, Maine, USA.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0601/pillarmaine_orloski_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Sun Pillar Over Maine&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0601/pillarmaine_orloski.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Stephanie Ziyi Ye&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2021-12-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;During polar day, in Arctic and Antarctic summer, the Sun stays above the horizon for periods of 24 hours or more.

Of course on that date, Union Glacier&#x27;s sky did grow dark even though the Sun was above the horizon. Captured during the brief period of totality, an eclipsed Sun is at bottom center of the composite view. Near the edge of the total eclipse path across planet Earth, the Moon&#x27;s shadow darkens the sky above.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2112/Eclipseclock-final2.JPG&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Eclipse on a Polar Day&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2112/Eclipseclock-final2_1024c.JPG&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2002-04-11&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What happens when galaxies collide? One of the best studied examples of the jumble of star clusters, gas, and dust clouds produced by such a cosmic train wreck is the interacting galaxy pair NGC 4038 / NGC 4039, the Antennae Galaxies, only sixty million light-years away. In visible light images, long, luminous tendrils of material seem to reach out from the galactic wreckage, lending the entwined pair an insect-like appearance. But this penetrating view from the new Wide-field InfraRed Camera (WIRC) attached to the Palomar Observatory&#x27;s 200 inch Hale telescope shows, in false-color, details of some otherwise hidden features. The large central nuclei of the two original galaxies dominate the near-infrared scene speckled with other bright sources which are themselves giant, newly formed star clusters. Remarkably the northern (topmost) nucleus, obscured in optical images, is also revealed here to have a barred, mini-spiral structure reminiscent of many \&quot;single\&quot; spiral galaxies.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0204/irantennae_wirc_full.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Antennae Galaxies in Near-Infrared&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0204/irantennae_wirc.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2013-08-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What would it look like to fly through the distant universe? To find out, a team of astronomers estimated the relative distances to over 5,000 galaxies in one of the most distant fields of galaxies ever imaged: the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). Because it takes light a long time to cross the universe, most galaxies visible in the above video are seen when the universe was only a fraction of its current age, were still forming, and have unusual shapes when compared to modern galaxies. No mature looking spiral galaxies such as our Milky Way or the Andromeda galaxy yet exist. Toward the end of the video the virtual observer flies past the farthest galaxies in the HUDF field, recorded to have a redshift past 8. This early class of low luminosity galaxies likely contained energetic stars emitting light that transformed much of the remaining normal matter in the universe from a cold gas to a hot ionized plasma.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Flight through the Hubble Ultra Deep Field&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDMp8a-YNe0?rel&#x3D;0&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2000-08-18&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A bevy of black holes and neutron stars shine as bright, point-like sources against bubbles of million degree gas in this false-color x-ray image from the orbiting Chandra Observatory. The striking picture shows the central regions of two galaxies, NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, locked in a titanic collision some 60 million light-years distant in the constellation Corvus. In visible light images, long, luminous, tendril-like structures emanating from the wreckage lend the pair their popular moniker, the Antennae Galaxies. Galactic collisions are now thought to be fairly common, but when they happen individual stars rarely collide. Instead gas and dust clouds merge and compress, triggering furious bursts of massive star formation with thousands of resulting supernovae. The exploding stars litter the scene with bubbles of shocked hot gas and collapsed stellar cores. Transfixed by this cosmic accident astronomers watch and are beginning to appreciate the collision-driven evolution of galaxies, not unlike our own.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/antennagal_cxo_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;X-Rays From Antennae Galaxies&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/antennagal_cxo.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-11-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;It is the largest and most sophisticated object ever built off the Earth.

Pictured above, the Sakurajima volcano in southern Japan was caught erupting early last month. Magma bubbles so hot they glow shoot away as liquid rock bursts through the Earth&#x27;s surface from below.  The above image is particularly notable, however, for the lightning bolts caught near the volcano&#x27;s summit.  Why lightning occurs even in common thunderstorms remains a topic of research, and the cause of volcanic lightning is even less clear. Surely, lightning bolts help quench areas of opposite but separated electric charges. One hypothesis holds that catapulting magma bubbles or volcanic ash are themselves electrically charged, and by their motion create these separated areas. Other volcanic lightning episodes may be facilitated by charge-inducing collisions in volcanic dust. Lightning is usually occurring somewhere on Earth, typically over 40 times each second.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1002/volcanolightning_rietze_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Sakurajima Volcano with Lightning&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1002/volcanolightning_rietze.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nRay Palmer\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2007-02-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Place your cursor on this stunning view through dark skies over western Australia to highlight wonders of the southern Milky Way -- including the famous Southern Cross, the dark Coal Sack Nebula, and bright reddish emission regions surrounding massive star Eta Carinae.

While cruising with its two-ton payload above 100,000 feet, the scientific balloon&#x27;s fully inflated internal volume was roughly the same as the Louisiana Superdome, but its walls were as thin as shrinkwrap. TIGER was designed to detect the unexplained galactic cosmic rays -- atomic nuclei moving at near light-speed which impinge on the Earth from outside our Solar System. By making the first sensitive measurements of cosmic rays with atomic numbers between 26 (Iron) and 40 (Zirconium), TIGER investigators will seek to identify the type of astrophysical environments which could be sources of the galactic cosmic-ray material and possible ways in which the nuclei are accelerated to such high speeds.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0202/tigerlaunchPan_jasonlink_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Balloon TIGER&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0202/tigerlaunchPan_jasonlink.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;1996-08-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Ribbons of red-glowing gas and dark dust surround massive young stars in this close-up of the Lagoon Nebula taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The Lagoon Nebula is relatively close and bright - it appears larger than the Full Moon and is visible even without a telescope. Light takes about 5000 years to reach here from there. The Lagoon Nebula houses the open star cluster M8.  This photograph is combination of exposures taken in the red, green and ultraviolet. The unusual bright central part of the Lagoon Nebula (lower left in this image) is known as the Hourglass Nebula.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/lagoon_hst_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Close-Up of the Lagoon Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/lagoon_hst.gif&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Giorgia Hofer&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A 26 hour old Moon poses behind the craggy outline of the Italian Dolomites in this twilight mountain and skyscape. The one second long exposure was captured near moonset on March 30. And while only a a sliver of its sunlit surface is visible, most of the Moon&#x27;s disk can be seen by earthshine as light reflected from a bright planet Earth illuminates the lunar nearside. Also known as the Moon&#x27;s ashen glow, a description of earthshine in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth&#x27;s oceans illuminating the Moon&#x27;s dark surface was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci. Of course earthshine is just the most familiar example of planetshine, the faint illumination of the dark portion of a moon by light reflected from its planet.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/GHR5997Luna1giornofirmapicc.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Da Vinci Glow&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/GHR5997Luna1giornofirmapicc1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2000-12-13&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The Manicouagan Crater in northern Canada is one of the oldest impact craters known.  Formed during a surely tremendous impact about 200 million years ago, the present day terrain supports a 70-kilometer diameter hydroelectric reservoir in the telltale form of an annular lake.  The crater itself has been worn away by the passing of glaciers and other erosional processes. Still, the hard rock at the impact site has preserved much of the complex impact structure and so allows scientists a leading case to help understand large impact features on Earth and other Solar System bodies.  Also visible above is the vertical fin of the Space Shuttle Columbia from which the picture was taken in 1983.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/manicouagan_sts9_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Manicouagan Impact Crater on Earth&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/manicouagan_sts9.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMia St\ufffdlnacke\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2015-03-30&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;It appeared, momentarily, like a 50-km tall banded flag.  In mid-March, an energetic Coronal Mass Ejection directed toward a clear magnetic channel to Earth led to one of the more intense geomagnetic storms of recent years. A visual result was wide spread auroras being seen over many countries near Earth&#x27;s magnetic poles.  Captured over Kiruna, Sweden, the image features an unusually straight auroral curtain with the green color emitted low in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and red many kilometers higher up. It is unclear where the rare purple aurora originates, but it might involve an unusual blue aurora at an even lower altitude than the green, seen superposed with a much higher red.  As the Sun continues near its top level of surface activity, colorful nights of auroras over Earth are likely to continue.

You might look out over a vast orange landscape covered with rocks under a dusty orange sky, with a blue-tinted Sun over the horizon, and odd-shaped water clouds hovering high overhead. This was just the view captured last March by NASA&#x27;s rolling explorer,  Perseverance. The orange coloring is caused by rusted iron in the Martian dirt, some of which is small enough to be swept up by winds into the atmosphere. The blue tint near the rising Sun is caused by blue light being preferentially scattered out from the Sun by the floating dust. The light-colored clouds on the right are likely composed of water-ice and appear high in the Martian atmosphere.  The shapes of some of these clouds are unusual for Earth and remain a topic of research.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/MarsClouds_Perseverance_2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ice Clouds over a Red Planet&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/MarsClouds_Perseverance_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2011-05-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Stars, like bees, swarm around the center of bright globular cluster M15.  This ball of over 100,000 stars is a relic from the early years of our Galaxy, and continues to orbit the Milky Way&#x27;s center.  M15, one of about 150 globular clusters remaining, is noted for being easily visible with only binoculars, having at its center one of the densest concentrations of stars known, and containing a high abundance of variable stars and pulsars.  This sharp image, taken by the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, spans about 120 light years. It shows the dramatic increase in density of stars toward the cluster&#x27;s center.  M15 lies about 35,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Winged Horse (Pegasus).  Recent evidence indicates that a massive black hole might reside as the center of M15.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1105/m15_hst_4089.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Globular Cluster M15 from Hubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1105/m15_hst_900.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nAnglo-Australian Telescope\nBoard\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;1995-11-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The unusual geometry of this stellar nebula creates somewhat of a mystery. At the nebula&#x27;s center is a young binary star system that probably created the nebula, but how? This type of nebula shows a \&quot;bipolar flow\&quot; which carries a significant amount of mass away from the central stars.  It has been speculated that the central stars create a pair of jets that precess like a spinning top.  These jets might throw gas into a thick disk which we see here edge on - so that it appears to us as a rectangle. The nebula emission is also unusual in that some of the infrared light it emits might be associated with unusual carbon-containing molecules.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/redrectangle_aat.gif&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Red Rectangle&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/redrectangle_aat.gif&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2020-01-14&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Are volcanoes still active on Venus?  More volcanoes are known on Venus than Earth, but when Venusian volcanoes last erupted is not directly known. Evidence bolstering very recent volcanism on Venus has recently been uncovered, though, right here on Earth. Lab results showed that images of surface lava would become dim in the infrared in only months in the dense Venusian atmosphere, a dimming not seen in ESA&#x27;s Venus Express images. Venus Express entered orbit around Venus in 2006 and remained in contact with Earth until 2014. Therefore, the infrared glow (shown in false-color red) recorded by Venus Express for Idunn Mons and featured here on a NASA Magellan image indicates that this volcano erupted very recently -- and is still active today.  Understanding the volcanics of Venus might lead to insight about the volcanics on Earth, as well as elsewhere in our Solar System.

Back in the old days, back when our Galaxy first formed, perhaps thousands of globular clusters roamed our Galaxy.  Today, there are less than 200 left.  Many globular clusters were destroyed over the eons by repeated fateful encounters with each other or the Galactic center.  Surviving relics are older than any Earth fossil, older than any other structures in our Galaxy, and limit the universe itself in raw age.  There are few, if any, young globular clusters in our Milky Way Galaxy because conditions are not ripe for more to form.  Pictured above by the Hubble Space Telescope are about 100,000 of M72&#x27;s stars. M72, which spans about 50 light years and lies about 50,000 light years away, can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Water Bearer (Aquarius).&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/m72_hst_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;M72: A Globular Cluster of Stars&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/m72_hst.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nGreg Piepol\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2008-02-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A new cycle has begun on our Sun.  Over the past year, the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field has reset and now a new 11 year period is beginning.  Pictured above in a specific color of light emitted by hydrogen is sunspot 10982, one of the last sunspots of the old solar cycle.   The two dark lines visible just above and to either side of the bright sunspot are cool filaments held aloft by the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field.  Hot and cold regions are shown as regions of relative light and dark, respectively. A solar cycle is caused by the changing magnetic field, and varies from solar maximum, when sunspot, coronal mass ejection, and flare phenomena are most frequent, to solar minimum, when such activity is relatively infrequent. Solar minimums occurred in 1996 and 2007, while the last solar maximum occurred in 2001.     Editor&#x27;s note: This APOD originally ran under the title \&quot;A Sunspot in the New Solar Cycle.\&quot; But even though the new solar cycle has begun, the old one has not ended yet and may run concurrently with the new cycle for up to a year or so. This sunspot is now thought to belong to the old cycle, not the new one, based on its measured magnetic polarity and location.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0802/sunspot10982_piepol_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Sunspot in the Old Solar Cycle&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0802/sunspot10982_piepol.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Ian Griffin&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2023-09-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;An analemma is that figure-8 curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun at the same time each day for one year. To make this one, a 4x5 pinhole camera was set up looking north in southern New Zealand skies. The shutter was briefly opened each clear day in the afternoon at 4pm local time exposing the same photosensitized glass plate for the year spanning September 23, 2022 to September 19, 2023. On two days, the winter and summer solstices, the shutter was opened again 15 minutes after the main exposure and remained open until sunset to create the sun trails at the bottom and top of the curve. The equinox dates correspond to positions in the middle of the curve, not the crossover point. Of course, the curve itself is inverted compared to an analemma traced from the northern hemisphere. And while fall begins today at the Autumnal Equinox for the northern hemisphere, it&#x27;s the Spring Equinox in the south.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2309/4pm-analemma-nz.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Afternoon Analemma&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2309/4pm-analemma-nz_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-07-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;It had never been done before. But with the words \&quot;You&#x27;re Go for landing\&quot;, 50 years ago this Saturday, Apollo 11 astronauts Aldrin and Armstrong were cleared to make the first try. The next few minutes would contain more than a bit of drama, as an unexpected boulder field and an unacceptably sloping crater loomed below.  With fuel dwindling, Armstrong coolly rocketed the lander above the lunar surface as he looked for a clear and flat place to land.  With only seconds of fuel remaining, and with the help of Aldrin and mission control calling out data, Armstrong finally found a safe spot -- and put the Eagle down.  Many people on Earth listening to the live audio felt great relief on hearing \&quot;The Eagle has landed\&quot;, and great pride knowing that for the first time ever, human beings were on the Moon. Combined in the featured descent video are two audio feeds, a video feed similar to what the astronauts saw, captions of the dialog, and data including the tilt of the Eagle lander. The video concludes with the panorama of the lunar landscape visible outside the Eagle. A few hours later, hundreds of millions of people across planet Earth, drawn together as a single species, watched fellow humans walk on the Moon.

This picture was taken at midnight near Fairbanks, Alaska, and captures familiar trees, common clouds, and a glowing sky markedly different than a sunset. Particularly strange is the green auroral ring caused by ionized oxygen high in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  The small water droplets composing clouds reflect and absorb aurora light, giving clouds a reddish tinge.  The above picture was taken on September 20th of last year.  In the next few years the Sun will reach the most active part of its 11 year cycle, meaning more puffs of high energy solar particles will be released, and more spectacular auroras will occur when these particles strike the Earth.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9805/aurora1_jc_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Aurora at Midnight&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9805/aurora1_jc.jpg&quot;}]
